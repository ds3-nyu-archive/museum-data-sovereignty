At the time of excavation, the site of Hawikuh was located on Zuni tribal lands. In 1921, the human remains were accessioned into the collections of the Museum of the American Indian. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Records identify the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurial 1263\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Hawikuh. Cranial morphology suggests that the human remains are consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. Consultation evidence, historic documents, and archeological data indicate Hawikuh was a Zuni settlement occupied from the 14th to 17th centuries. Zuni traditions identify the region around Hawikuh as their ancestral territory. Archeological data suggest that the site was inhabited since circa A.D. 1300. The first historic records of Hawikuh were made by the Spanish in 1536; over the next 150 years the Spanish documented their visits and missions at Hawikuh, which they identified as one of the seven cities of Cibola. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Zuni resettled at the location of the current Zuni Pueblo. Oral tradition and historic records describe both the revolt and the subsequent aggregation of Zuni people at the Zuni Pueblo. For a number of years, some Zuni periodically returned to Hawikuh for short stays. \\n        The Spanish granted the land at Hawikuh and other Zuni villages to the Zuni in 1689. The Zuni have remained in the area to the present-day. The present Zuni reservation was first established by Executive Order in 1877, although the boundaries were subsequently modified. The Zuni voted to hold elections under the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, and adopted a constitution in 1970. Today the Zuni Tribe is recognized as the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 21, 2009.

The human remains were removed from a village at Waacht, on the Makah Indian Reservation, Clallam County, WA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3).

Waterman. That same year, Waterman donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Waterman\\'s notes indicate that the human remains were removed from a deserted house at the west end of Waacht. Based on Waterman\\'s description of the house, it has been determined that the human remains were removed from tribal lands. In this house, Waterman found the cranial remains of two individuals in a wooden case. One of the individuals, an adult, was associated with whaling objects. The other individual was a juvenile. Forensic examination identified the individual in the possession of the College of Dentistry as the remains of a child. Basketry in the wooden case and elsewhere in the house were identified as the craftwork of Dase\\'LtEb. Waterman concluded that the human remains of the adult were those of Mr. McCarty, the husband of Dase\\'LtEb. Although Waterman\\'s records name the adult as Mr. McCarty, they do not name the juvenile. Tribal representatives discussed this matter with members of the McCarty family. Information provided by members of the McCarty family indicates that the human remains of the child may belong to a nephew of Mr. McCarty, but no lineal descendants have been identified. \\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.

In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Museum of the American Indian records identify the locality of origin of the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAboriginal burial, Broadway and Isham Streets, New York City.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This location is in present-day Inwood, on the island of Manhattan, New York City, Bronx County. The cranial morphology of the human remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. Objects found at the Broadway and Isham Street location, but not in the museum\\'s collection, suggest that the site dates to the late Late Woodland, Protohistoric or early Historic Periods, A.D. 1400-1650. The Inwood area is documented historically, archeologically and by tribal traditions as the territory of the Munsee Delaware-speaking people since at least the Late Woodland period. Manhattan was largely vacated by the Munsee during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and the Munsee of Manhattan joined other Munsee communities to their north and west. Some Munsee people became part of the Stockbridge community that eventually settled in Wisconsin. Today, their descendants are members of the Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin. Other Munsee were integrated into Unami Delaware-speaking groups who moved through the Midwest and/or Texas before settling on reservation land in Oklahoma. Today, these groups are known as the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma and the Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma. Consultation evidence supports the identification of the human remains from the Broadway and Isham Streets site as Munsee and their cultural affiliation with the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.

Cranial morphology and tooth shape is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. New York State Historic Preservation Office site files identify the Burgett site as the Ely Site, RMSC HNE 124. Archeologists have interpreted the Ely Site as a protohistoric Seneca site based on the ceramic types, pipe styles, lithics, and European materials present at the site and found in association with the burials. Consultations with the Seneca Nation of New York, Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York confirm the identification of the Ely Site as a Seneca site.\\n        After European contact, the Seneca were divided geopolitically into two groups, the Eastern Seneca and the Western Seneca. The Eastern Seneca remained in New York, while the Western Seneca moved to Ohio and then Oklahoma.

In 1785, the village was abandoned following a smallpox epidemic and its inhabitants moved to the Knife River region to live alongside the Hidatsa. By 1862, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara lived at the Like-A-Fishook village. In 1937, the three tribes became formally known as the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation.

Harrington. The remains were discovered during an expedition sponsored by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The remains were catalogued into the collections of the Museum of the American Indian in 1922. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Harrington identified all of the archeological material associated with the human remains at both rockshelters as part of the Bluff Dweller culture. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBluff Dweller\\xe2\\x80\\x9d material dates to the Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods. The distinction between these two time periods is not well-defined. Both components are part of the James River complex, which lasted from approximately 2000 B.C. to A.D. 100. The James River complex was spread throughout the Ozarks, a broad geographic area that includes several subtraditions, although no subtradition has yet been defined for the region that includes the rockshelters. The shelters in the region were likely used by small groups of people from multiple adjacent, culturally discrete regions for specific subsistence or other resource procurement activities. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        At the time of European contact, the areas of the Allred Bluff Rockshelter and Salts Bluff Rockshelter were inhabited by the Osage people. Osage tradition identifies the area of Benton County as part of the ancestral territory of the Osage. The Osage ceded their land in Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma between 1808 and 1825. For a while, they retained hunting rights in the region and their use of the Ozarks is documented in early 19th century records. The Osage were ultimately relocated to Oklahoma, where their reservation was established in 1872. \\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot reasonably be traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of three individuals to the Osage Nation, Oklahoma. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Osage Nation, Oklahoma.\\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the physical remains to the Osage Nation, Oklahoma, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.

In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of one individual to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada, on behalf of a coalition of tribes in the Great Basin region. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada. \\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the human remains to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before July 12, 2010. Disposition of the human remains to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes of the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, Nevada and Oregon; Lovelock Paiute Tribe of the Lovelock Indian Colony, Nevada; Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada; Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of the Pyramid Lake Reservation, Nevada; Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, Nevada; Walker River Paiute Tribe of the Walker River Reservation, Nevada; and Yerington Paiute Tribe of the Yerington Colony &amp; Campbell Ranch, Nevada, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: April 27, 2010\\n          David Tarler,\\n          Acting Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 2010-14041 Filed 6-10-10; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4312-50-S\\n</td>\n",

The human remains were removed from multiple sites in Davidson and Williamson counties, TN.\\n        \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(b)(5), the NYU College of Dentistry discussed a proposed disposition, and all four tribes determined that The Chickasaw Nation would take the lead on the reburial for all of the human remains described below.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 14 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from several mound and earthwork sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry.\\n        The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: Three adults of indeterminate sex and two adult males from the East Nashville Mounds site (40Dv4) in Davidson County, TN; one adult female removed from the Gordontown site (40Dv6) in Davidson County, TN; one older adult male, one adult male, one probable adult female, and one older adult of indeterminate sex removed from the Old Town site (40Wm2) in Williamson County, TN; and two older adults of indeterminate sex, one older adult male, and one young adult female removed from the DeGraffenreid site (40Wm4), in Williamson County, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified.\\n        Each of the sites listed in this notice date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450), based on the burial styles, artifacts, radiocarbon dating, Tennessee site file information, and archeological literature. The sites and the surrounding region were abandoned by A.D. 1450. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450.\\n        Historically, the land from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land that included modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805.\\n        Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry\\n        Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of, at a minimum, 14 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma and, if joined to one or more of the afore-mentioned aboriginal land tribes, The Chickasaw Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by May 4, 2018.

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood &amp; Tampa Reservations); and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma.\\n        In 1937, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a mound at Lettuce Lake, (8Bd7), Broward County, FL. The mound was excavated by Geoffrey Olson and William C. Orchard as part of an expedition sponsored by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The remains were accessioned by the Museum of the American Indian in 1937. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Artifacts recovered from the mound indicate that it dates to the Glades IIIa Period, A.D. 1200-1400, and is a Glades culture site of the Glades Tradition. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. There is evidence for cultural continuity between the Glades IIIa Period and the post-contact people of the Broward County area. In the Historic Period, the area around Broward County is identified as Tequesta territory. In 1513, Tequesta villages were described in the records of the Ponce de Leon expedition. The Tequesta suffered from diseases and other disrupting forces of European contact, and, by 1743, a distinct group that could be identified as Tequesta had disappeared. In 1763, the remnant communities of Native Floridians in south Florida were taken to Cuba when Florida was transferred from Spanish to British control. \\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a mound at Hog Island, Levy County, FL. It is likely that the remains were collected by William Bryant in 1918. The remains from Hog Island were in the collection of William L. Bryant when it was sold to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in 1920. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n\\n        Hog Island is located within the North Peninsular Coast region. Florida state site files identify a Weeden Island Period burial mound, 8Lv2, on Hog Island. Artifacts from the mound indicate that it is associated with the Weeden Island 2 phase of the Weeden Island I Period, circa A.D. 150-450. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. During the Weeden Island II Period (circa A.D. 600-1200), the North Peninsular coastal region of Florida remained a distinct region. The cultural sequence after A.D. 1200 is difficult to determine. The Safety Harbor culture to the south, the Northwest Florida cultures to the northwest, and Alachua culture to the east abut the region, but do not extend into the Northwest Peninsular Coast area. The early Spanish explorations of Ponce de Leon, Narvaez, and DeSoto did not enter the coastal Northwest Florida Peninsular areas. The Spanish did not establish any missions in the region after claiming La Florida. As a result, there is no information from early colonial documents regarding any people living in this region. This stands in marked contrast to the records for the area from Tampa Bay to the south and for the northwest coast of Florida. There are also no records to identify people from the region in subsequent French or English documents. It is likely that inhabitants of the Northwest Peninsular Coast quickly felt the effects of European diseases that were introduced by the Spanish in the early 16th century. As in other portions of Florida, their communities probably shrank in size until only a small portion of the original population was left. These people may have sought refuge elsewhere in Florida, but were never identified. \\n        In 1920, human remains representing a minimum of seven individuals were removed from an unidentified mound in East Florida by Charles Hallock. The remains and objects from the mound were loaned by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in 1920. According to archival records, the loan was made permanent in 1967. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The specific site and age for the remains is not known, but the morphology of the remains is consistent with individuals of Native American ancestry. In prehistoric cultural sequences, the area of eastern Florida is identified with the St. Johns culture, whose territory lay in the portions of eastern and central Florida where the St. Johns River and its tributaries flow. The St. Johns tradition first appeared around 500 B.C. and continued until European contact. It is divided into several periods, all of which include burial mounds. In 16th century records, the people living in the St. Johns River area are identified as the Timucua. Historic mission records suggest that diseases introduced between 1562 and 1595 had decimated the population in the St. Johns River area. Additional epidemics in the first half of the 17th century resulted in massive population loss and changes to the diet, health, economy, and religion of the Timucua. In 1684, the British began to attack the Spanish missions where the Timucua were living in order to gain control of Florida. At the same time, the missions were also subject to slave raiding by tribes from the north. By 1704, all missions but St. Augustine were destroyed and the remaining Timucua took refuge at it. In 1711, only 942 Timucua and Apalachee were living around St. Augustine. Slave raiding, disease, and English attacks further reduced the population; by 1759, only 59 Timucua and Apalachee remained at St. Augustine. The Spanish withdrew from St. Augustine between 1763-1764, taking the 89 Indians from St. Augustine with them to Cuba. \\n        In all three sites mentioned-above, the population vacuum created by the absence of Florida tribal groups opened the state to migration by the Lower Creek. The first Creek settlements were located in northern Florida. Conflicts with the British, and then the American government, pushed the Creek into the southern half of the state. These Creek communities grew independent of Creek nations to the north and became known as the Seminole and Miccosukee.\\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of nine individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot reasonably be traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of nine individuals to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.\\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before July 26, 2010. Disposition of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood &amp; Tampa Reservations); and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: June 18, 2010\\n          David Tarler,\\n          Acting Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 2010-15286 Filed 6-23-10; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4312-50-S\\n</td>\n",

The human remains were removed from unknown sites in the State of Tennessee.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 4 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry.\\n        The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: One young adult male removed from an unknown site on the Harpeth River, likely in Williamson County, TN; one adult male of indeterminate age and one individual of indeterminate age and sex removed from an unknown site, TN; and one probable male adult removed from a stone grave at an unknown site, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified.\\n        Although the specific sites from which the remains were removed are not known, Jones excavated sites along the Cumberland and Big Harpeth Rivers in present-day Davidson and Williamson counties. The sites he excavated date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450) and were abandoned after that time. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450.\\n        Historically, the area from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land in modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to the land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. Without knowing the precise location of the burial sites, it is not possible to determine if the human remains were removed from the ceded lands of the Cherokee or the Chickasaw, but it is likely that they were removed from the area represented by their combined land claims in Davidson and Williamson counties.\\n        Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry\\n        Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of, at a minimum, 4 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by May 4, 2018.

The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land in modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to the land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. Without knowing the precise location of the burial sites, it is not possible to determine if the human remains were removed from the ceded lands of the Cherokee or the Chickasaw, but it is likely that they were removed from the area represented by their combined land claims in Davidson and Williamson counties. \\n</td>\n",

The human remains were acquired by Dr. Joseph Jones of Louisiana at an unknown date. In 1906, the widow of Dr. Jones sold his collection to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Museum records indicate that the human remains are from an unknown location and are those of a Creek individual. The attribution of a tribal affiliation of Creek in the museum records suggests that the remains may date to the Historic period. No information from the museum records, osteological assessment, or consultation conflicts with this interpretation. Tribal representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma, support the identification of the human remains as Creek. \\n        In the late 1800s or early 1900s, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Kyle Mound, Muscogee County, GA, by Friend W. Miller. In 1946, they were acquired by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Archeological data, including pottery types and shell gorgets, indicate that Kyle Mound was a Late Mississippian mound. It was part of the Chattahoochee subtradition of the Lamar Complex and likely dates to the late Rood or Bull Creek phase, circa A.D. 1200-1475. A Protohistoric or Historic period cemetery surrounded the mound. The Lower Creek village of Kasihta was located next to the mound and cemetery. The village was first identified in historic records in 1732, but had already been in existence for some time. It was a major regional center until the residents were relocated from the village to Oklahoma in 1836.\\n        Tribal representatives identified the Lower Chattahoochee River as part of the ancestral territory of the Hitchiti-speaking Lower Creek people. A continuous occupation of Hitchiti speakers in the region from the Rood phase to the Historic period is suggested by archeological and historic records. Most Lower Creek voluntarily relocated or were forcibly removed to Oklahoma in the first half of the 19th century. The Upper Creek nations and nations who were part of the Creek Confederacy, such as the Alabama and Koasati, were also relocated to Oklahoma. Before their final removal to Oklahoma, some Alabama and Koasati established a community in Texas. Consultation evidence indicates that some members of the Federally-recognized nations descended from the Creek Confederacy trace their ancestry specifically to the village of Kasihta. \\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.

Information associated with the human remains identify them as \\xe2\\x80\\x9c----- [illegible] Saugema, Ottawa Tribe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Ottawa are also known by the name Odawa. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaugema\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an Odawa family name in the Mackinaw area and variants are recorded for the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa. Although a surname is listed for the human remains, lineal descendants could not be identified because the specific identity of the individual could not be determined. The identification of a surname indicates that the human remains date to the Historic period.\\n        The area of Mackinaw City corresponds to the territory of the Odawas after European contact. The Odawa people entered the written record in 1615, when the French encountered them at the eastern shores of Lake Huron on the Georgian Bay. Soon after this, the Odawas left the Lower Peninsula of Michigan because of Iroquoian raids, but returned to Michigan after the Iroquois were repelled from the area by the Odawas and other Great Lakes tribes in the mid-1600s. By 1673, the Odawas had established villages at the Straits of Mackinac. One village was located at Michilimackinac, in present-day Mackinaw City. A letter dating to 1710 describes Odawa mortuary practices at Michilimackinac that are consistent with the physical condition of the human remains. Odawa people have remained in the Mackinaw area since their return in the 17th century. In addition, Odawa oral traditions identify the Mackinac area as an area of aboriginal occupation for many generations prior to European contact, and Mackinaw City is part of the ancestral lands of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan. \\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before June 1, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan and Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: April 13, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

In 1703, the Shinnecock and town of Southampton reached an agreement in which the Shinnecock held a 1,000 year lease of approximately 3,500 acres, including Shinnecock Hills. The area was subsequently referred to as the Shinnecock Reservation in various state and local documents. The Shinnecock renegotiated their lease in 1859 and relinquished the lands at Shinnecock Hills in exchange for fee title to the land at Shinnecock Neck. The current Shinnecock Reservation, which no longer includes Shinnecock Hills, was placed into trust after the tribe was federally recognized in 2010.

The human remains were removed from the cemetery at Kienuka, Niagara County, NY. \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Tuscarora Nation of New York.\\n        In 1903, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from the cemetery at Kienuka in Niagara County, NY, by John MacKay. The remains were subsequently added to the collection of William MacKay, John MacKay\\'s brother. The Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, purchased William MacKay\\'s collection in 1918. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Kienuka is located within the boundaries of the Tuscarora Reservation, which was established in 1797. The removal occurred prior to the Antiquities Act, and, therefore, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, is not asserting control. Archival and historical records suggest that the removal of the remains was not authorized by the Tuscarora Nation and that a law enforcement official from the Tuscarora Nation investigated the desecration of the cemetery but was unable to arrest anyone. \\n        Kienuka was a Neutral village of the early 17th century, and the morphology of the remains is consistent with individuals of Native American ancestry. The Neutral were a confederacy of Iroquoian speakers who lived to the south and north of the eastern half of Lake Erie. Their name was derived from the neutral position they occupied geographically and sociopolitically between the Huron and Iroquois Confederacies. Between 1647 and 1651, the Neutral coalition was fractured and its people were decimated as a result of warfare with the Iroquois nations. The Neutral ceased to be identified as a distinct group by 1660. \\n        In 1713, the Tuscarora migrated to New York from North Carolina. The Tuscarora were adopted as the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1722 and 1723. After the Revolutionary War, the Tuscarora settled on the east side of the Niagara River. The Tuscarora Nation received their land grant, which includes portions of Niagara County, in 1797. Their reservation was subsequently expanded and continues to include the site of Kienuka. \\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of two individuals to the Tuscarora Nation of New York. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Tuscarora Nation of New York.\\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the physical remains to the Tuscarora Nation of New York, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.

By 1924, the human remains were donated to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation by Mrs. George Heye.

The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry. In the late 19th century, Edward William Nelson, Smithsonian Institution naturalist, observed burials in the region. The human remains were placed in wooden boxes that were elevated onto poles. The boxes or poles were marked with totems to which tools or other necessary items were attached. The boxes were exposed and highly visible to collectors. Based on the preservation observed in excavations on the Seward Peninsula, it is likely that the human remains are associated with the Western Thule tradition, and postdate A.D. 1000. \\n        In the Western Thule tradition, the people of the Seward Peninsula were highly localized, with differences in their lifeways based on the particular resources available in their territory. Localization may have occurred alongside the development of geopolitical boundaries. Port Clarence was focused on whaling, and was part of the Sinrarmiut or Port Clarence territory of Inupiaq speakers at the time of European contact.

Davis. That same year, Davis donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Records identify the human remains as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Papago skeleton exhumed from burial place\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian Oasis, Arizona.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Papago are also known by the name Tohono O\\'odham. Indian Oasis is today known as Sells, AZ. The Tohono O\\'odham consider Sells to be part of their ancestral homelands. The O\\'odham people are identified in 16th century Spanish documents as living in present-day northern Mexico and southern Arizona. Several documents record Tohono O\\'odham communities in the region in the late 17th century. The Tohono O\\'odham remained in southern Arizona, even during the Apache raids of the 19th century, and several winter or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell villages\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were located in the Sells district. Tohono O\\'odham residents of Kui Tatk and Tecolote, two defensive villages at the time of the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, resettled into the village of Artesa, which later became part of Sells. In the early 20th century, Sells was identified as Komoktetuvavosit, a well village. In 1916, the Tohono O\\'odham Reservation was established by Executive Order. In 1937, the Tohono O\\'odham Nation was recognized under the Indian Reorganization Act. \\n        The assignment of a tribal affiliation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPapago\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the human remains suggests that they date to the late 17th to mid-20th centuries, the time period for which variants of the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPapago\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were in use. The cranial morphology of the human remains is consistent with biometric data from early 20th century Tohono O\\'odham communities. The description of the human remains as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold\\xe2\\x80\\x9d skeleton implies that the burial predated the more recent cemetery burials around Sells. Prior to the adoption of cemeteries as burial areas, individuals were placed in protected locations such as cairns. The condition and the weathering pattern of the human remains are consistent with a cairn or other protected burial area. \\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.

The human remains are well-preserved and the morphology is consistent with Native American ancestry. There are four cultural phases for the Cape Nome area, the Denbigh Flint Complex, Norton, Birnirk, and Cape Nome phases. Because preservation of human remains is extremely rare for sites in the Cape Nome region that predate the Cape Nome phase, it is likely that the human remains date to the Cape Nome phase, circa A.D. 1000-1800. The Cape Nome phase corresponds to the Western Thule tradition of the Bering Sea region.

At an unknown date, the human remains were acquired by C.B. Moore. In 1917, Mr. Moore donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as Crab Creek Coulee, WA. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry. The condition of the human remains suggests that they were removed from a Historic Period burial that probably dated to the 1800s. \\n        Tribal representatives identified Crab Creek, Grant County, WA, as part of the ancestral territory of both the Wanapum and Sinkayuse. Historic records from the early 19th century document Wanapum and Sinkayuse villages in Grant County. The northern boundary of the Wanapum extended to Crab Creek, while the southern edge of the Sinkayuse territory extended to Crab Creek. The extremities of the territories were defined by diffuse boundaries, and boundaries shifted according to who lived in or utilized land along the creek. At the time, the people living in the region did not organize themselves according to a tribe in the modern-day sense. Organization was along family, clan, and village lines. Trading and intermarriage were common between villages and groups. \\n        During the 19th century, some Wanapum became part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation, Washington, while others remained part of the state-recognized Wanapum Band that stayed in their ancestral territory. The Sinkayuse relocated among the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington. Today, all three groups maintain close relations and coordinate repatriations for human remains from Grant County.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before August 6, 2009.

The human remains were removed from Hempstead County, AR.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and Osage Nation, Oklahoma.\\n        In 1916, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from the Ozan 5 Site (3HE59), Hempstead County, AR, by Mark Harrington, as part of a Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation expedition. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as the Ozan 5 Site, AR, and provide specific skeleton numbers, 13 and 17, for the human remains. These human remains were excavated from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMain Cemetery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Ozan 5 site. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry and the cranial remodeling exhibited by one individual is consistent with Caddoan cultural practices. Pottery types and burial styles suggest that the cemetery dates to sometime between A.D. 1400 and 1700. \\n        In 1916, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals were removed from the Washington Site (3HE35), Hempstead County, AR, by Mark Harrington, as part of a Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation expedition.

No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as the Washington Site, AR. All three sets of remains were removed from Mound 10, with one individual removed from burial 90 and the remaining two individuals removed from burial 93. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry and the cranial remodeling exhibited by two individuals is consistent with Caddoan mortuary practices. Pottery types and burial styles suggest that the cemetery dates to sometime between A.D. 1400 and 1600.\\n        Hempstead County is part of the Texarkana or Big Bend archeological region. Caddoan traditions identify the Texarkana region as part of the Caddo homelands and locate the point of origin of the Caddo people near the Red River or Hot Springs, in the Big Bend region. Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric phases for this area include the Belcher and Texarkana phases. These phases are associated with Caddoan-speaking people who became known as the Kadohadacho. The first historic records of the Kadohadocho villages in the Big Bend region of the Red River are from DeSoto\\'s travels in 1542. The Kadohadacho remained in the region until the late 18th century. In 1835, the Kadohadacho ceded their land and united with other Caddoan groups in Texas. In 1859, the Caddo relocated to Oklahoma. In 1938, the Caddo organized as the Caddo Nation under the Indian Reorganization Act. Support for the cultural relationship between historic Kadohadacho and pre-Contact sites in the Big Bend region can be seen in the continuity of mortuary practices. During consultations, Caddo representatives identified the burials from these sites as Caddo and provided oral tradition, ethnographic, and archeological evidence to support this identification.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of five individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before October 22, 2009.

The human remains were removed from an unknown location or locations.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from an unknown location or locations. At an unknown date, Dr. Joseph Jones of Louisiana added the human remains to his collection. In 1906, the widow of Dr. Jones sold his collection to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The original records of Dr. Jones identify the human remains as Comanche, but do not list a locality for them. Museum records also identify the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComanche.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The attribution of a tribal affiliation of Comanche in the museum records suggests that the human remains may date to the historic period. Forensic data corroborate the tribal attribution and estimated age for the individuals. One cranium has cutmarks that appear to have been made near the time of death by a metal knife. The other cranium shows evidence of cradleboarding, which was practiced by the Comanche in the historic period. Both sets of remains exhibit weathering that would be expected for the rock or scaffold burial locations that were preferred by the Comanche during the historic period. During consultation, the tribal representative for the Comanche Nation supported the identification of the human remains as Comanche.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before October 23, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: September 2, 2009\\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from Hawikuh, Cibola County, NM.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        In February 1921, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurial 1263\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at Hawikuh, Cibola County, NM, during legally permitted excavations by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. At the time of excavation, the site of Hawikuh was located on Zuni tribal lands. In 1921, the human remains were accessioned into the collections of the Museum of the American Indian. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Records identify the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurial 1263\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Hawikuh. Cranial morphology suggests that the human remains are consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. Consultation evidence, historic documents, and archeological data indicate Hawikuh was a Zuni settlement occupied from the 14th to 17th centuries. Zuni traditions identify the region around Hawikuh as their ancestral territory. Archeological data suggest that the site was inhabited since circa A.D. 1300. The first historic records of Hawikuh were made by the Spanish in 1536; over the next 150 years the Spanish documented their visits and missions at Hawikuh, which they identified as one of the seven cities of Cibola. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Zuni resettled at the location of the current Zuni Pueblo. Oral tradition and historic records describe both the revolt and the subsequent aggregation of Zuni people at the Zuni Pueblo. For a number of years, some Zuni periodically returned to Hawikuh for short stays. \\n        The Spanish granted the land at Hawikuh and other Zuni villages to the Zuni in 1689. The Zuni have remained in the area to the present-day. The present Zuni reservation was first established by Executive Order in 1877, although the boundaries were subsequently modified. The Zuni voted to hold elections under the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, and adopted a constitution in 1970. Today the Zuni Tribe is recognized as the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 21, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry and Bureau of Indian Affairs are responsible for notifying the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation of New Mexico that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          \\n          Dated: July 24, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from an unknown location.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; and Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unknown location. They were acquired by Dr. Joseph Jones of Louisiana at an unknown date. In 1906, the widow of Dr. Jones sold his collection to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Museum of the American Indian records indicate that the human remains are from an unknown location, but possibly either from Louisiana or Mississippi, and are the human remains of a Choctaw individual. The cranial morphology of the human remains confirms that they belong to an individual of Native American ancestry. No information from the museum records, osteological assessment, or consultation conflicts with the identification of the human remains as Choctaw. Tribal representatives of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; and Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi, support the identification of the human remains as Choctaw, and identify both Louisiana and Mississippi as the ancestral homelands of the Choctaw.\\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; and Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before June 8, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; and Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; and Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: April 13, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from a village at Waacht, on the Makah Indian Reservation, Clallam County, WA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington.\\n        In January 1921, human remains representing one individual were removed from an unoccupied house at Waacht, on the Makah Indian Reservation, Neah Bay, Clallam County, WA, by T.T. Waterman. That same year, Waterman donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Waterman\\'s notes indicate that the human remains were removed from a deserted house at the west end of Waacht. Based on Waterman\\'s description of the house, it has been determined that the human remains were removed from tribal lands. In this house, Waterman found the cranial remains of two individuals in a wooden case. One of the individuals, an adult, was associated with whaling objects. The other individual was a juvenile. Forensic examination identified the individual in the possession of the College of Dentistry as the remains of a child. Basketry in the wooden case and elsewhere in the house were identified as the craftwork of Dase\\'LtEb. Waterman concluded that the human remains of the adult were those of Mr. McCarty, the husband of Dase\\'LtEb. Although Waterman\\'s records name the adult as Mr. McCarty, they do not name the juvenile. Tribal representatives discussed this matter with members of the McCarty family. Information provided by members of the McCarty family indicates that the human remains of the child may belong to a nephew of Mr. McCarty, but no lineal descendants have been identified. \\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before November 12, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        New York University College of Dentistry and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are responsible for notifying the Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: September 8, 2009\\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from Bronx County, NY.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe (part of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma); and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.\\n        In 1911, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a grave at Broadway and Isham Streets, Inwood, New York, NY, by Reginald P. Bolton. In 1917, the human remains were accessioned by the Department of Physical Anthropology at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Museum of the American Indian records identify the locality of origin of the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAboriginal burial, Broadway and Isham Streets, New York City.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This location is in present-day Inwood, on the island of Manhattan, New York City, Bronx County. The cranial morphology of the human remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. Objects found at the Broadway and Isham Street location, but not in the museum\\'s collection, suggest that the site dates to the late Late Woodland, Protohistoric or early Historic Periods, A.D. 1400-1650. The Inwood area is documented historically, archeologically and by tribal traditions as the territory of the Munsee Delaware-speaking people since at least the Late Woodland period. Manhattan was largely vacated by the Munsee during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and the Munsee of Manhattan joined other Munsee communities to their north and west. Some Munsee people became part of the Stockbridge community that eventually settled in Wisconsin. Today, their descendants are members of the Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin. Other Munsee were integrated into Unami Delaware-speaking groups who moved through the Midwest and/or Texas before settling on reservation land in Oklahoma. Today, these groups are known as the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma and the Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma. Consultation evidence supports the identification of the human remains from the Broadway and Isham Streets site as Munsee and their cultural affiliation with the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 21, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: July 24, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from the Ely Site, Monroe County, NY.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Seneca Nation of New York, Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York.\\n        Around 1940, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the Burgett or Ely Site (RMSC HNE 124), Monroe County, NY, by Robert Hill. In 1941, the remains were accessioned by the Department of Physical Anthropology at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin of the human remains as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurgett Site, West Rush, N.Y.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Labels with the remains repeat this information and specify that they were removed from burial 12 or 13. Cranial morphology and tooth shape is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. New York State Historic Preservation Office site files identify the Burgett site as the Ely Site, RMSC HNE 124. Archeologists have interpreted the Ely Site as a protohistoric Seneca site based on the ceramic types, pipe styles, lithics, and European materials present at the site and found in association with the burials. Consultations with the Seneca Nation of New York, Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York confirm the identification of the Ely Site as a Seneca site.\\n        After European contact, the Seneca were divided geopolitically into two groups, the Eastern Seneca and the Western Seneca. The Eastern Seneca remained in New York, while the Western Seneca moved to Ohio and then Oklahoma. The Eastern Seneca are represented today by two Federally-recognized tribes, the Seneca Nation of New York and Tonawanda Band of Seneca of New York. The Western Seneca are represented by the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Seneca Nation of New York, Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before October 22, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Seneca Nation of New York, Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Seneca Nation of New York, Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: September 2, 2009\\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from Morton County, ND.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from On-A-Slant Village, Ft. Abraham Lincoln, near Bismarck, Morton County, ND, by an unknown collector. In 1925, the human remains were accessioned by the Department of Physical Anthropology at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records identify the provenience of the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFt. Abraham Lincoln, near Bismarck, North Dakota.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fort Abraham Lincoln is also the site of a Historic Period Mandan Village known as On-A-Slant Village (32MO26). The cranium of one of the individuals is painted with a red pigment matching historically described and archeologically confirmed mortuary customs of the Mandan. \\n\\n        On-A-Slant Village is documented historically, archeologically and by tribal oral traditions as a village of the Plains Village Period dating to A.D. 1450-1785, and occupied by the Nuitadi subgroup of the Mandan. In 1785, the village was abandoned following a smallpox epidemic and its inhabitants moved to the Knife River region to live alongside the Hidatsa. By 1862, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara lived at the Like-A-Fishook village. In 1937, the three tribes became formally known as the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation. Consultation evidence supports the identification of the human remains from the On-A-Slant Village as Mandan, and the cultural affiliation as the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.\\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before June 1, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: April 13, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from the Allred Bluff and Salts Bluff Rockshelters, Benton County, AR.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and Osage Nation, Oklahoma.\\n        In 1923, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from the Allred Bluff Rockshelter, Benton County, AR, by M.R. Harrington. The remains were discovered during an expedition sponsored by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The remains were catalogued into the collections of the Museum of the American Indian in 1923. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        In 1922, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the Salts Bluff Rockshelter Shelter 1, Benton County, AR, by M.R. Harrington. The remains were discovered during an expedition sponsored by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The remains were catalogued into the collections of the Museum of the American Indian in 1922. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Harrington identified all of the archeological material associated with the human remains at both rockshelters as part of the Bluff Dweller culture. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBluff Dweller\\xe2\\x80\\x9d material dates to the Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods. The distinction between these two time periods is not well-defined. Both components are part of the James River complex, which lasted from approximately 2000 B.C. to A.D. 100. The James River complex was spread throughout the Ozarks, a broad geographic area that includes several subtraditions, although no subtradition has yet been defined for the region that includes the rockshelters. The shelters in the region were likely used by small groups of people from multiple adjacent, culturally discrete regions for specific subsistence or other resource procurement activities. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        At the time of European contact, the areas of the Allred Bluff Rockshelter and Salts Bluff Rockshelter were inhabited by the Osage people. Osage tradition identifies the area of Benton County as part of the ancestral territory of the Osage. The Osage ceded their land in Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma between 1808 and 1825. For a while, they retained hunting rights in the region and their use of the Ozarks is documented in early 19th century records. The Osage were ultimately relocated to Oklahoma, where their reservation was established in 1872. \\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot reasonably be traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of three individuals to the Osage Nation, Oklahoma. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Osage Nation, Oklahoma.\\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the physical remains to the Osage Nation, Oklahoma, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.

The human remains were removed from Lovelock Cave, Churchill County, NV.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes of the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, Nevada and Oregon; Lovelock Paiute Tribe of the Lovelock Indian Colony, Nevada; Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada; Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of the Pyramid Lake Reservation, Nevada; Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, Nevada; Walker River Paiute Tribe of the Walker River Reservation, Nevada; and Yerington Paiute Tribe of the Yerington Colony & Campbell Ranch, Nevada.\\n        In 1924, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Lovelock Cave, Churchill County, NV. The remains were removed by M.R. Harrington during excavations jointly conducted by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley. In 1956, the remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The remains date to the Early Lovelock I Phase occupation of the cave, circa 2500-1500 B.C. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. Archeological, linguistic, and oral tradition evidence indicate that different groups of people occupied the region over time. By at least A.D. 1500, Lovelock Cave was part of the territory of the Northern Paiute. The Lovelock Paiute Tribe of the Lovelock Indian Colony, Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of the Pyramid Lake Reservation, and Walker River Paiute Tribe of the Walker River Reservation, identify the region surrounding Lovelock Cave as part of their traditional homeland.\\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot reasonably be traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of one individual to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada, on behalf of a coalition of tribes in the Great Basin region. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada. \\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the human remains to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before July 12, 2010. Disposition of the human remains to the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony, Nevada, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York

The human remains were removed from multiple sites in Davidson and Williamson counties, TN.\\n        \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(b)(5), the NYU College of Dentistry discussed a proposed disposition, and all four tribes determined that The Chickasaw Nation would take the lead on the reburial for all of the human remains described below.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 14 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from several mound and earthwork sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry.\\n        The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: Three adults of indeterminate sex and two adult males from the East Nashville Mounds site (40Dv4) in Davidson County, TN; one adult female removed from the Gordontown site (40Dv6) in Davidson County, TN; one older adult male, one adult male, one probable adult female, and one older adult of indeterminate sex removed from the Old Town site (40Wm2) in Williamson County, TN; and two older adults of indeterminate sex, one older adult male, and one young adult female removed from the DeGraffenreid site (40Wm4), in Williamson County, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified.\\n        Each of the sites listed in this notice date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450), based on the burial styles, artifacts, radiocarbon dating, Tennessee site file information, and archeological literature. The sites and the surrounding region were abandoned by A.D. 1450. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450.\\n        Historically, the land from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land that included modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN.

The human remains were removed from Broward and Levy Counties, FL, and an unknown mound in East Florida.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations); and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma.\\n        In 1937, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a mound at Lettuce Lake, (8Bd7), Broward County, FL. The mound was excavated by Geoffrey Olson and William C. Orchard as part of an expedition sponsored by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The remains were accessioned by the Museum of the American Indian in 1937. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Artifacts recovered from the mound indicate that it dates to the Glades IIIa Period, A.D. 1200-1400, and is a Glades culture site of the Glades Tradition. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. There is evidence for cultural continuity between the Glades IIIa Period and the post-contact people of the Broward County area. In the Historic Period, the area around Broward County is identified as Tequesta territory. In 1513, Tequesta villages were described in the records of the Ponce de Leon expedition. The Tequesta suffered from diseases and other disrupting forces of European contact, and, by 1743, a distinct group that could be identified as Tequesta had disappeared. In 1763, the remnant communities of Native Floridians in south Florida were taken to Cuba when Florida was transferred from Spanish to British control. \\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a mound at Hog Island, Levy County, FL. It is likely that the remains were collected by William Bryant in 1918. The remains from Hog Island were in the collection of William L. Bryant when it was sold to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in 1920. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n\\n        Hog Island is located within the North Peninsular Coast region. Florida state site files identify a Weeden Island Period burial mound, 8Lv2, on Hog Island. Artifacts from the mound indicate that it is associated with the Weeden Island 2 phase of the Weeden Island I Period, circa A.D. 150-450. The morphology of the remains is consistent with an individual of Native American ancestry. During the Weeden Island II Period (circa A.D. 600-1200), the North Peninsular coastal region of Florida remained a distinct region. The cultural sequence after A.D. 1200 is difficult to determine. The Safety Harbor culture to the south, the Northwest Florida cultures to the northwest, and Alachua culture to the east abut the region, but do not extend into the Northwest Peninsular Coast area. The early Spanish explorations of Ponce de Leon, Narvaez, and DeSoto did not enter the coastal Northwest Florida Peninsular areas. The Spanish did not establish any missions in the region after claiming La Florida. As a result, there is no information from early colonial documents regarding any people living in this region. This stands in marked contrast to the records for the area from Tampa Bay to the south and for the northwest coast of Florida. There are also no records to identify people from the region in subsequent French or English documents. It is likely that inhabitants of the Northwest Peninsular Coast quickly felt the effects of European diseases that were introduced by the Spanish in the early 16th century. As in other portions of Florida, their communities probably shrank in size until only a small portion of the original population was left. These people may have sought refuge elsewhere in Florida, but were never identified. \\n        In 1920, human remains representing a minimum of seven individuals were removed from an unidentified mound in East Florida by Charles Hallock. The remains and objects from the mound were loaned by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in 1920. According to archival records, the loan was made permanent in 1967. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The specific site and age for the remains is not known, but the morphology of the remains is consistent with individuals of Native American ancestry. In prehistoric cultural sequences, the area of eastern Florida is identified with the St. Johns culture, whose territory lay in the portions of eastern and central Florida where the St. Johns River and its tributaries flow. The St. Johns tradition first appeared around 500 B.C. and continued until European contact. It is divided into several periods, all of which include burial mounds. In 16th century records, the people living in the St. Johns River area are identified as the Timucua. Historic mission records suggest that diseases introduced between 1562 and 1595 had decimated the population in the St. Johns River area. Additional epidemics in the first half of the 17th century resulted in massive population loss and changes to the diet, health, economy, and religion of the Timucua. In 1684, the British began to attack the Spanish missions where the Timucua were living in order to gain control of Florida. At the same time, the missions were also subject to slave raiding by tribes from the north. By 1704, all missions but St. Augustine were destroyed and the remaining Timucua took refuge at it. In 1711, only 942 Timucua and Apalachee were living around St. Augustine. Slave raiding, disease, and English attacks further reduced the population; by 1759, only 59 Timucua and Apalachee remained at St. Augustine. The Spanish withdrew from St. Augustine between 1763-1764, taking the 89 Indians from St. Augustine with them to Cuba. \\n        In all three sites mentioned-above, the population vacuum created by the absence of Florida tribal groups opened the state to migration by the Lower Creek. The first Creek settlements were located in northern Florida. Conflicts with the British, and then the American government, pushed the Creek into the southern half of the state. These Creek communities grew independent of Creek nations to the north and became known as the Seminole and Miccosukee.\\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of nine individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot reasonably be traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of nine individuals to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.\\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before July 26, 2010. Disposition of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations); and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: June 18, 2010\\n          David Tarler,\\n          Acting Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 2010-15286 Filed 6-23-10; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4312-50-S\\n       \n",

The human remains were removed from unknown sites in the State of Tennessee.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 4 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry.\\n        The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: One young adult male removed from an unknown site on the Harpeth River, likely in Williamson County, TN; one adult male of indeterminate age and one individual of indeterminate age and sex removed from an unknown site, TN; and one probable male adult removed from a stone grave at an unknown site, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified.\\n        Although the specific sites from which the remains were removed are not known, Jones excavated sites along the Cumberland and Big Harpeth Rivers in present-day Davidson and Williamson counties. The sites he excavated date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450) and were abandoned after that time. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450.\\n        Historically, the area from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land in modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to the land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. Without knowing the precise location of the burial sites, it is not possible to determine if the human remains were removed from the ceded lands of the Cherokee or the Chickasaw, but it is likely that they were removed from the area represented by their combined land claims in Davidson and Williamson counties.\\n        Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry\\n        Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of, at a minimum, 4 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by May 4, 2018.

The human remains were removed from an unknown location and from Kyle Mound, Muscogee County, GA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unknown location. The human remains were acquired by Dr. Joseph Jones of Louisiana at an unknown date. In 1906, the widow of Dr. Jones sold his collection to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Museum records indicate that the human remains are from an unknown location and are those of a Creek individual. The attribution of a tribal affiliation of Creek in the museum records suggests that the remains may date to the Historic period. No information from the museum records, osteological assessment, or consultation conflicts with this interpretation. Tribal representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma, support the identification of the human remains as Creek. \\n        In the late 1800s or early 1900s, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Kyle Mound, Muscogee County, GA, by Friend W. Miller. In 1946, they were acquired by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Archeological data, including pottery types and shell gorgets, indicate that Kyle Mound was a Late Mississippian mound. It was part of the Chattahoochee subtradition of the Lamar Complex and likely dates to the late Rood or Bull Creek phase, circa A.D. 1200-1475. A Protohistoric or Historic period cemetery surrounded the mound. The Lower Creek village of Kasihta was located next to the mound and cemetery. The village was first identified in historic records in 1732, but had already been in existence for some time. It was a major regional center until the residents were relocated from the village to Oklahoma in 1836.\\n        Tribal representatives identified the Lower Chattahoochee River as part of the ancestral territory of the Hitchiti-speaking Lower Creek people. A continuous occupation of Hitchiti speakers in the region from the Rood phase to the Historic period is suggested by archeological and historic records. Most Lower Creek voluntarily relocated or were forcibly removed to Oklahoma in the first half of the 19th century. The Upper Creek nations and nations who were part of the Creek Confederacy, such as the Alabama and Koasati, were also relocated to Oklahoma. Before their final removal to Oklahoma, some Alabama and Koasati established a community in Texas. Consultation evidence indicates that some members of the Federally-recognized nations descended from the Creek Confederacy trace their ancestry specifically to the village of Kasihta. \\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.

The human remains were removed from an unknown location.\\n\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations).\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unknown location. The human remains were acquired by Dr. Joseph Jones of Louisiana at an unknown date. In 1906, the widow of Dr. Jones sold his collection to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Museum records indicate that the human remains are from an unknown location, and are the human remains of a Seminole individual whose last name was Tigertail. This name is a known surname among the Seminole. The identification of a surname and tribal affiliation indicates that the human remains date to post-Contact times. Although a surname is listed for the individual, lineal descendants could not be identified because the full name of the individual could not be determined. Despite the inability to determine lineal descendants, no information from the museum records, osteological assessment, or consultation conflicts with the identification of the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeminole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d During consultations, tribal representatives supported the identification of the human remains as Seminole. Today, descendants of the Seminole are members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida. \\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 23, 2010.

The human remains were removed from Santa Barbara County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians of the Santa Ynez Reservation, California.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the Burton Mound, Santa Barbara County, CA, by an unknown individual. In 1924, the human remains were acquired by Frederick Hodge, and he donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation that same year. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as the Burton Mound, Santa Barbara, CA. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry. Burton Mound was located at the Chumash village of Syujtun at the time of Spanish contact, in 1542. The inhabitants of the village were identified as Barbareno Chumash. Use of the mound stopped in the early 19th century and the Spanish settled in the area. Artifacts found in the mound suggest that it dates to the Prehistoric and Protohistoric phases of the Late Horizon.\\n        In 1919, human remains representing a minimum of 71 individuals were removed from San Miguel Island, Santa Barbara County, CA, by Ralph Glidden, as part of a Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation expedition. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as San Miguel Island, CA, but do not list a specific site or sites from which the human remains were removed. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry. San Miguel Island has a long occupation history with strong evidence for group continuity over millennia. The island was vacated by the 19th century, as the remaining residents were relocated to Spanish missions on the mainland. The inhabitants of the island were identified as Island Chumash speakers.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Santa Cruz Island, Santa Barbara County, CA, during the DeMoss Bowers expedition. In 1915, the human remains were donated to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as Santa Cruz Island, CA, but do not list a specific site from which the human remains were removed.

The inhabitants of the island were identified as Island Chumash speakers.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of nine individuals were removed from Santa Cruz Island, Santa Barbara County, CA, by an unknown individual. The human remains were in the collection of Louis Dreyfus when it was purchased by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in 1917. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified.

The island was vacated by the 19th century, as the remaining residents were relocated to Spanish missions on the mainland. Inhabitants of the island were identified as Island Chumash speakers.\\n        Consultation, historical, and archeological evidence indicate that Santa Barbara, San Miguel Island, and Santa Cruz Island are part of the traditional territory of the Chumash. Tribal representatives identify the Northern Channel Islands and the mainland along the Santa Barbara Channel, as the traditional territory of the Chumash tribes. On the mainland, archeological data from the early historic sites shows strong continuity with Protohistoric and Late Horizon material. On the islands, there is archeological evidence of continuous occupation by the same group of people for at least 4,000 years. \\n        The first historic records of the Chumash villages in the Santa Barbara area date to 1542. By 1805, the Chumash remaining in the area were relocated onto five missions in the vicinity of Santa Barbara and Ventura, on the mainland of California. The missions were secularized and largely abandoned by the Chumash in 1832. In 1855, the Santa Ynez Reservation was created for the Chumash, and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash was recognized in 1901. \\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of 82 individuals of Native American ancestry.

The human remains were removed from Mackinaw City, Cheboygan County, MI.\\n\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan and Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Mackinaw City in Cheboygan County, MI. At an unknown date, the human remains came into the possession of Walter C. Wyman of Chicago, IL. In 1915, Mr. Wyman donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York City, NY. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Based on the cranial morphology of the human remains, the individual is identified as Native American. Information associated with the human remains identify them as \\xe2\\x80\\x9c----- [illegible] Saugema, Ottawa Tribe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Ottawa are also known by the name Odawa. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaugema\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an Odawa family name in the Mackinaw area and variants are recorded for the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa. Although a surname is listed for the human remains, lineal descendants could not be identified because the specific identity of the individual could not be determined. The identification of a surname indicates that the human remains date to the Historic period.\\n        The area of Mackinaw City corresponds to the territory of the Odawas after European contact. The Odawa people entered the written record in 1615, when the French encountered them at the eastern shores of Lake Huron on the Georgian Bay. Soon after this, the Odawas left the Lower Peninsula of Michigan because of Iroquoian raids, but returned to Michigan after the Iroquois were repelled from the area by the Odawas and other Great Lakes tribes in the mid-1600s. By 1673, the Odawas had established villages at the Straits of Mackinac. One village was located at Michilimackinac, in present-day Mackinaw City. A letter dating to 1710 describes Odawa mortuary practices at Michilimackinac that are consistent with the physical condition of the human remains. Odawa people have remained in the Mackinaw area since their return in the 17th century. In addition, Odawa oral traditions identify the Mackinac area as an area of aboriginal occupation for many generations prior to European contact, and Mackinaw City is part of the ancestral lands of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan. \\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before June 1, 2009.

The human remains were removed from Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, Long Island, NY.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of Indians; Shinnecock Indian Nation; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, NY. In 1926, the town of Southampton donated the human remains, which consist of the cranial fragments of one adult, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. They were accessioned into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation that same year. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, NYU College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The age of the human remains cannot be determined from the available information. Forensic examination revealed diagnostic features of an individual with Native American ancestry. Without any information about the site or age of the remains, no identifiable earlier group can be determined.\\n        Shinnecock Hills, which lies near the northeastern end of Long Island, is not included in any treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders that establish aboriginal land. The area is, however, within territory that was long recognized by the tribe, the town of Southampton, and the state of New York as Shinnecock land. In 1703, the Shinnecock and town of Southampton reached an agreement in which the Shinnecock held a 1,000 year lease of approximately 3,500 acres, including Shinnecock Hills. The area was subsequently referred to as the Shinnecock Reservation in various state and local documents. The Shinnecock renegotiated their lease in 1859 and relinquished the lands at Shinnecock Hills in exchange for fee title to the land at Shinnecock Neck.

The human remains were removed from Colfax County, NE.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from a site identified as a Pawnee Burial Site, Schuyler, Colfax County, NE, by an unknown collector. In 1922, the human remains were accessioned by the Department of Physical Anthropology at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff at the New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records identify the provenience of the human remains as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPawnee Burial Site, Schuyler, Nebraska.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cranial morphology of the human remains confirms that they belong to an individual of Pawnee ancestry. Consultations with the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma confirmed the identification of the human remains from the burial site as Pawnee. \\n        Schuyler, NE, is located along the Loup River, and corresponds to an area of protohistoric (Lower Loup phase) and historic Pawnee villages that have been identified as Pawnee by the Pawnee Nation and archeologists. It is likely that the human remains date to the Lower Loup phase or historic period. The Loup River area was settled by the Skidi Pawnee, one of four Pawnee bands, by 1700. Skidi Pawnee sites are identified in historic documents dating as early as 1718, and they remained the primary Pawnee band in the area for the next century. By 1857, all four Pawnee bands coalesced along the Loup River after disease, warfare and land cessions resulted in a restriction of Pawnee lands. By 1875, the Pawnee left the Loup River and settled on a tract of land in Oklahoma. Today they are known as the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before June 1, 2009.

The human remains were removed from the cemetery at Kienuka, Niagara County, NY. \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Tuscarora Nation of New York.\\n        In 1903, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from the cemetery at Kienuka in Niagara County, NY, by John MacKay. The remains were subsequently added to the collection of William MacKay, John MacKay\\'s brother. The Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, purchased William MacKay\\'s collection in 1918. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Kienuka is located within the boundaries of the Tuscarora Reservation, which was established in 1797. The removal occurred prior to the Antiquities Act, and, therefore, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, is not asserting control. Archival and historical records suggest that the removal of the remains was not authorized by the Tuscarora Nation and that a law enforcement official from the Tuscarora Nation investigated the desecration of the cemetery but was unable to arrest anyone. \\n        Kienuka was a Neutral village of the early 17th century, and the morphology of the remains is consistent with individuals of Native American ancestry. The Neutral were a confederacy of Iroquoian speakers who lived to the south and north of the eastern half of Lake Erie. Their name was derived from the neutral position they occupied geographically and sociopolitically between the Huron and Iroquois Confederacies. Between 1647 and 1651, the Neutral coalition was fractured and its people were decimated as a result of warfare with the Iroquois nations. The Neutral ceased to be identified as a distinct group by 1660. \\n        In 1713, the Tuscarora migrated to New York from North Carolina. The Tuscarora were adopted as the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1722 and 1723. After the Revolutionary War, the Tuscarora settled on the east side of the Niagara River. The Tuscarora Nation received their land grant, which includes portions of Niagara County, in 1797. Their reservation was subsequently expanded and continues to include the site of Kienuka. \\n        Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In July 2009, the New York University College of Dentistry requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of the culturally unidentifiable human remains of two individuals to the Tuscarora Nation of New York. The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the human remains to the Tuscarora Nation of New York.\\n\\n        A March 4, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Official, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the College to effect disposition of the physical remains to the Tuscarora Nation of New York, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before July 12, 2010. Disposition of the human remains to the Tuscarora Nation of New York may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Tuscarora Nation of New York that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: May 27, 2010\\n          David Tarler,\\n          Acting Manager,

The human remains were removed from Port Clarence, Nome County, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Native Village of Brevig Mission and Native Village of Teller.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unidentified site at Port Clarence, Nome County, AK, by an unknown individual. By 1924, the human remains were donated to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation by Mrs. George Heye. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry (NYUCD #334). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the origin of the human remains as Port Clarence, AK, which is located on the Seward Peninsula. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry. In the late 19th century, Edward William Nelson, Smithsonian Institution naturalist, observed burials in the region. The human remains were placed in wooden boxes that were elevated onto poles. The boxes or poles were marked with totems to which tools or other necessary items were attached. The boxes were exposed and highly visible to collectors. Based on the preservation observed in excavations on the Seward Peninsula, it is likely that the human remains are associated with the Western Thule tradition, and postdate A.D. 1000. \\n        In the Western Thule tradition, the people of the Seward Peninsula were highly localized, with differences in their lifeways based on the particular resources available in their territory. Localization may have occurred alongside the development of geopolitical boundaries. Port Clarence was focused on whaling, and was part of the Sinrarmiut or Port Clarence territory of Inupiaq speakers at the time of European contact. Today, the descendants of the people of Port Clarence are represented by the Native Villages of Brevig Mission and Teller. Both communities made seasonal use of Port Clarence in the 20th century, and tribal representatives have identified Port Clarence as part of their ancestral territory.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Native Village of Brevig Mission and Native Village of Teller.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 23, 2010. Repatriation of the human remains to the Native Village of Brevig Mission and Native Village of Teller may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Native Village of Brevig Mission and Native Village of Teller that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: August

The human remains were removed from Pima County, AZ.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        In February 1919, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a burial area in Sells, which is within the Tohono O\\'odham Reservation, Pima County, AZ, by E.H. Davis. That same year, Davis donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Records identify the human remains as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Papago skeleton exhumed from burial place\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian Oasis, Arizona.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Papago are also known by the name Tohono O\\'odham. Indian Oasis is today known as Sells, AZ. The Tohono O\\'odham consider Sells to be part of their ancestral homelands. The O\\'odham people are identified in 16th century Spanish documents as living in present-day northern Mexico and southern Arizona. Several documents record Tohono O\\'odham communities in the region in the late 17th century. The Tohono O\\'odham remained in southern Arizona, even during the Apache raids of the 19th century, and several winter or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell villages\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were located in the Sells district. Tohono O\\'odham residents of Kui Tatk and Tecolote, two defensive villages at the time of the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, resettled into the village of Artesa, which later became part of Sells. In the early 20th century, Sells was identified as Komoktetuvavosit, a well village. In 1916, the Tohono O\\'odham Reservation was established by Executive Order. In 1937, the Tohono O\\'odham Nation was recognized under the Indian Reorganization Act. \\n        The assignment of a tribal affiliation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPapago\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the human remains suggests that they date to the late 17th to mid-20th centuries, the time period for which variants of the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPapago\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were in use. The cranial morphology of the human remains is consistent with biometric data from early 20th century Tohono O\\'odham communities. The description of the human remains as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold\\xe2\\x80\\x9d skeleton implies that the burial predated the more recent cemetery burials around Sells. Prior to the adoption of cemeteries as burial areas, individuals were placed in protected locations such as cairns. The condition and the weathering pattern of the human remains are consistent with a cairn or other protected burial area. \\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before June 8, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry and Bureau of Indian Affairs are responsible for notifying the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: April 14, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from Cape Nome, Nome County, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Nome Eskimo Community.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unidentified site at Cape Nome, AK, by an unknown individual. By 1924, the human remains were donated to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation by Mrs. George Heye. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as Cape Nome, AK. The human remains are well-preserved and the morphology is consistent with Native American ancestry. There are four cultural phases for the Cape Nome area, the Denbigh Flint Complex, Norton, Birnirk, and Cape Nome phases. Because preservation of human remains is extremely rare for sites in the Cape Nome region that predate the Cape Nome phase, it is likely that the human remains date to the Cape Nome phase, circa A.D. 1000-1800. The Cape Nome phase corresponds to the Western Thule tradition of the Bering Sea region. In the Western Thule tradition, the people of the Seward Peninsula were highly localized, with differences in their lifeways based on the particular resources available in their territory. Localization may have occurred alongside the development of geopolitical boundaries. Cape Nome was a coastal area with a focus on smaller sea mammals.\\n        Cape Nome was part of the Ayaasaeiarmiut or Cape Nome territory of Inupiaq speakers at the time of Euroamerican contact. Burials at Cape Nome were described by Edward Nelson in the late 19th century. Nelson observed that human remains were placed in wooden boxes that were elevated onto poles. The boxes were exposed to the elements and highly visible to collectors.\\n        Archeological and consultation evidence indicates that the Ayaasaeiarmiut Inupiaq inhabited the Cape Nome area since at least A.D. 1000. Today, the descendants of the people of Cape Nome are represented by the Nome Eskimo Community.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Nome Eskimo Community.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 21, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Nome Eskimo Community may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Nome Eskimo Community that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: July 24, 2009.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

The human remains were removed from Crab Creek Coulee, Grant County, WA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group.\\n\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unknown site on the Crab Creek Coulee, Grant County, WA, by Harlan Smith. At an unknown date, the human remains were acquired by C.B. Moore. In 1917, Mr. Moore donated the human remains to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as Crab Creek Coulee, WA. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry. The condition of the human remains suggests that they were removed from a Historic Period burial that probably dated to the 1800s. \\n        Tribal representatives identified Crab Creek, Grant County, WA, as part of the ancestral territory of both the Wanapum and Sinkayuse. Historic records from the early 19th century document Wanapum and Sinkayuse villages in Grant County. The northern boundary of the Wanapum extended to Crab Creek, while the southern edge of the Sinkayuse territory extended to Crab Creek. The extremities of the territories were defined by diffuse boundaries, and boundaries shifted according to who lived in or utilized land along the creek. At the time, the people living in the region did not organize themselves according to a tribe in the modern-day sense. Organization was along family, clan, and village lines. Trading and intermarriage were common between villages and groups. \\n        During the 19th century, some Wanapum became part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation, Washington, while others remained part of the state-recognized Wanapum Band that stayed in their ancestral territory. The Sinkayuse relocated among the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington. Today, all three groups maintain close relations and coordinate repatriations for human remains from Grant County.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before August 6, 2009. Repatriation of the human remains to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: June 15, 2009\\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Walkers Slough Mound is a historic site (A.D. 1770-1850) located near Stockton, in the area of the San Joaquin River Valley. The mound lies at the southern edge of aboriginal territory of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the northern edge of aboriginal territory of the Northern Valley Yokut.\\n        The territorial divisions within the aboriginal lands of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the Northern Valley Yokut was diffuse and shifted through time. During consultation, tribal representatives stated that the early anthropological studies of the Yokuts and Miwok incorrectly divided these groups into discrete tribelets and overemphasized linguistic differences. Tribal representatives explained that although different dialects were spoken, the Miwok spoke a mutually intelligible language. The Yokuts also spoke a mutually intelligible language with regional dialects. Tribal representatives indicated that high population mobility and frequent intermarriage between groups during the historic period has resulting in a relationship of shared group identity for all Miwok tribes.

The human remains were removed from Hempstead County, AR.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and Osage Nation, Oklahoma.\\n        In 1916, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from the Ozan 5 Site (3HE59), Hempstead County, AR, by Mark Harrington, as part of a Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation expedition. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as the Ozan 5 Site, AR, and provide specific skeleton numbers, 13 and 17, for the human remains. These human remains were excavated from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMain Cemetery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Ozan 5 site. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry and the cranial remodeling exhibited by one individual is consistent with Caddoan cultural practices. Pottery types and burial styles suggest that the cemetery dates to sometime between A.D. 1400 and 1700. \\n        In 1916, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals were removed from the Washington Site (3HE35), Hempstead County, AR, by Mark Harrington, as part of a Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation expedition. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum of the American Indian records list the locality of origin as the Washington Site, AR. All three sets of remains were removed from Mound 10, with one individual removed from burial 90 and the remaining two individuals removed from burial 93. The morphology of the human remains is consistent with Native American ancestry and the cranial remodeling exhibited by two individuals is consistent with Caddoan mortuary practices. Pottery types and burial styles suggest that the cemetery dates to sometime between A.D. 1400 and 1600.\\n        Hempstead County is part of the Texarkana or Big Bend archeological region. Caddoan traditions identify the Texarkana region as part of the Caddo homelands and locate the point of origin of the Caddo people near the Red River or Hot Springs, in the Big Bend region. Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric phases for this area include the Belcher and Texarkana phases. These phases are associated with Caddoan-speaking people who became known as the Kadohadacho. The first historic records of the Kadohadocho villages in the Big Bend region of the Red River are from DeSoto\\'s travels in 1542. The Kadohadacho remained in the region until the late 18th century. In 1835, the Kadohadacho ceded their land and united with other Caddoan groups in Texas. In 1859, the Caddo relocated to Oklahoma. In 1938, the Caddo organized as the Caddo Nation under the Indian Reorganization Act. Support for the cultural relationship between historic Kadohadacho and pre-Contact sites in the Big Bend region can be seen in the continuity of mortuary practices. During consultations, Caddo representatives identified the burials from these sites as Caddo and provided oral tradition, ethnographic, and archeological evidence to support this identification.\\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of five individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before October 22, 2009.

       "I_1031  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\n Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains in the possession of the New York University College of Dentistry. The human remains were removed from Fresno County, CA. \\n This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n Consultation \\n A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\n History and Description of the Remains \\n At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in the city of Fresno, in Fresno County, CA. In 1923, the remains were catalogued into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology, Museum of the American Indian. In 1956, the remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n Determinations Made by the New York University College of Dentistry \\n Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that: \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Based on catalog information and forensic examination, the human remains are Native American. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission, the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Yokuts and southern Miwok, who are represented today by The Tribes. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The unratified treaty of 1851 indicates that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Yokuts and southern Miwok, who are represented today by The Tribes. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains is to The Tribes. \\n Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains or any other Indian tribe that believes it satisfies the criteria in 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1) should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before August 20, 2012. Disposition of the human remains to The Tribes may proceed after that date if no additional requestors come forward. \\n The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying The Tribes that this notice has been published. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "I_1030  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\n Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains in the possession of the New York University College of Dentistry. The human remains were removed from Rincon, in Santa Cruz County, CA. \\n This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n Consultation \\n A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Big Sandy Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Cold Springs Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\n History and Description of the Remains \\n At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in Rincon, in Santa Cruz County, CA by an unknown individual. At an unknown date, the remains were catalogued into the Department of Physical Anthropology, Museum of the American Indian. In 1956, the remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n Determinations Made by the New York University College of Dentistry \\n Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that: \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Based on catalog information and forensic examination, the human remains are Native American. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission, the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the southern Yokut and western Mono, who are represented today by The Tribes. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The unratified treaty of 1851 indicates that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the southern Yokut and western Mono, who are represented today by The Tribes. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains is to The Tribes. \\n Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains or any other Indian tribe that believes it satisfies the criteria in 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1) should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before August 20, 2012. Disposition of the human remains to The Tribes may proceed after that date if no additional requestors come forward. \\n The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying The Tribes that this notice has been published. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "I_319   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\n Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry, New York City, NY. The human remains were removed from multiple sites in Davidson and Williamson counties, TN.\\n         \\n This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n Consultation \\n A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(b)(5), the NYU College of Dentistry discussed a proposed disposition, and all four tribes determined that The Chickasaw Nation would take the lead on the reburial for all of the human remains described below. \\n History and Description of the Remains \\n Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 14 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from several mound and earthwork sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry. \\n The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: Three adults of indeterminate sex and two adult males from the East Nashville Mounds site (40Dv4) in Davidson County, TN; one adult female removed from the Gordontown site (40Dv6) in Davidson County, TN; one older adult male, one adult male, one probable adult female, and one older adult of indeterminate sex removed from the Old Town site (40Wm2) in Williamson County, TN; and two older adults of indeterminate sex, one older adult male, and one young adult female removed from the DeGraffenreid site (40Wm4), in Williamson County, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified. \\n Each of the sites listed in this notice date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450), based on the burial styles, artifacts, radiocarbon dating, Tennessee site file information, and archeological literature. The sites and the surrounding region were abandoned by A.D. 1450. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450. \\n Historically, the land from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land that included modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. \\n Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry \\n Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that: \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of, at a minimum, 14 individuals of Native American ancestry. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma and, if joined to one or more of the afore-mentioned aboriginal land tribes, The Chickasaw Nation. \\n Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by May 4, 2018. After that date, if no additional requestors have come forward, transfer of control of the human remains to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, and, if joined to one or more of the afore-mentioned aboriginal land tribes, The Chickasaw Nation, may proceed. \\n The NYU College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma that this notice has been published. \\n    \n",

       "I_316   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\n Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry, New York City, NY. The human remains were removed from unknown sites in the State of Tennessee. \\n This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n Consultation \\n A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. \\n History and Description of the Remains \\n Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 4 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry. \\n The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: One young adult male removed from an unknown site on the Harpeth River, likely in Williamson County, TN; one adult male of indeterminate age and one individual of indeterminate age and sex removed from an unknown site, TN; and one probable male adult removed from a stone grave at an unknown site, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified. \\n Although the specific sites from which the remains were removed are not known, Jones excavated sites along the Cumberland and Big Harpeth Rivers in present-day Davidson and Williamson counties. The sites he excavated date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450) and were abandoned after that time. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450. \\n Historically, the area from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land in modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to the land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. Without knowing the precise location of the burial sites, it is not possible to determine if the human remains were removed from the ceded lands of the Cherokee or the Chickasaw, but it is likely that they were removed from the area represented by their combined land claims in Davidson and Williamson counties. \\n Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry \\n Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that: \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of, at a minimum, 4 individuals of Native American ancestry. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. \\n Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by May 4, 2018. After that date, if no additional requestors have come forward, transfer of control of the human remains to the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma may proceed. \\n The NYU College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Chickasaw Nation, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma that this notice has been published. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "I_264   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\n Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry, New York City, NY. The human remains were removed from Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, Long Island, NY. \\n This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n Consultation \\n A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NYU College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of Indians; Shinnecock Indian Nation; and Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin. \\n History and Description of the Remains \\n At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, NY. In 1926, the town of Southampton donated the human remains, which consist of the cranial fragments of one adult, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. They were accessioned into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation that same year. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, NYU College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The age of the human remains cannot be determined from the available information. Forensic examination revealed diagnostic features of an individual with Native American ancestry. Without any information about the site or age of the remains, no identifiable earlier group can be determined. \\n Shinnecock Hills, which lies near the northeastern end of Long Island, is not included in any treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders that establish aboriginal land. The area is, however, within territory that was long recognized by the tribe, the town of Southampton, and the state of New York as Shinnecock land. In 1703, the Shinnecock and town of Southampton reached an agreement in which the Shinnecock held a 1,000 year lease of approximately 3,500 acres, including Shinnecock Hills. The area was subsequently referred to as the Shinnecock Reservation in various state and local documents. The Shinnecock renegotiated their lease in 1859 and relinquished the lands at Shinnecock Hills in exchange for fee title to the land at Shinnecock Neck. The current Shinnecock Reservation, which no longer includes Shinnecock Hills, was placed into trust after the tribe was federally recognized in 2010. The Department of Interior proposed finding on the Shinnecock petition for federal recognition identifies Shinnecock Hills as part of the pre-1859 Shinnecock Reservation. \\n Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry \\n Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that: \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on diagnostic cranial features observed during forensic examination. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Authoritative governmental documents, including the Shinnecock Indian Nation\\'s federal recognition decision, state agreements, and local property records indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Shinnecock Indian Nation. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Shinnecock Indian Nation. \\n Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by September 7, 2018. After that date, if no additional requestors have come forward, transfer of control of the human remains to the Shinnecock Indian Nation may proceed. \\n The NYU College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Shinnecock Indian Nation that this notice has been published. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "I_1032  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\n Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains in the possession of the New York University College of Dentistry. The human remains were removed from San Joaquin County, CA. \\n This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n Consultation \\n A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; California Valley Miwok Tribe, California; Chicken Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, California; Ione Band of Miwok Indians of California; Jackson Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California; and the United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\n History and Description of the Remains \\n At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from Rhoads Mound in San Joaquin County, CA. At an unknown date, they became part of the collection of H.K. Deisher, which was sold in 1905. In 1916, the remains were catalogued into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology, Museum of the American Indian. In 1956, the remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n Rhoads Mound is a protohistoric site (A.D. 1500-1770) located on Roberts Island in the San Joaquin-Sacramento River delta. The island lies at the southern edge of aboriginal territory of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the northern edge of aboriginal territory of the Northern Valley Yokut. \\n At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from Walkers Slough Mound in San Joaquin County, CA. At an unknown date, they became part of the collection of H.K. Deisher, which was sold in 1905. In 1916, the remains were catalogued into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology, Museum of the American Indian. In 1956, the remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n The Walkers Slough Mound is a historic site (A.D. 1770-1850) located near Stockton, in the area of the San Joaquin River Valley. The mound lies at the southern edge of aboriginal territory of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the northern edge of aboriginal territory of the Northern Valley Yokut. \\n The territorial divisions within the aboriginal lands of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the Northern Valley Yokut was diffuse and shifted through time. During consultation, tribal representatives stated that the early anthropological studies of the Yokuts and Miwok incorrectly divided these groups into discrete tribelets and overemphasized linguistic differences. Tribal representatives explained that although different dialects were spoken, the Miwok spoke a mutually intelligible language. The Yokuts also spoke a mutually intelligible language with regional dialects. Tribal representatives indicated that high population mobility and frequent intermarriage between groups during the historic period has resulting in a relationship of shared group identity for all Miwok tribes. Similarly, tribal representatives indicated that the Yokuts are all interrelated due to high population mobility and frequent intermarriage between groups. \\n Tribal representatives identified the descendants of the Eastern Miwok among the members of the Federally-recognized Miwok communities, including the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; California Valley Miwok Tribe, California; Chicken Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, California; Ione Band of Miwok Indians of California; Jackson Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), California; Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California; and the United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California. Tribal representatives identified the descendants of the Northern Valley Yokut among the Federally recognized Yokut tribes, including the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California. \\n Determinations Made by the New York University College of Dentistry \\n Officials of the New York University College of Dentistry have determined that: \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry. \\n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and The Tribes. \\n Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before August 20, 2012. Repatriation of the human remains to The Tribes may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying The Tribes that this notice has been published. \\n                                                              \n",

       "I_319   Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 14 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from several mound and earthwork sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry. \\n The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: Three adults of indeterminate sex and two adult males from the East Nashville Mounds site (40Dv4) in Davidson County, TN; one adult female removed from the Gordontown site (40Dv6) in Davidson County, TN; one older adult male, one adult male, one probable adult female, and one older adult of indeterminate sex removed from the Old Town site (40Wm2) in Williamson County, TN; and two older adults of indeterminate sex, one older adult male, and one young adult female removed from the DeGraffenreid site (40Wm4), in Williamson County, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified. \\n Each of the sites listed in this notice date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450), based on the burial styles, artifacts, radiocarbon dating, Tennessee site file information, and archeological literature. The sites and the surrounding region were abandoned by A.D. 1450. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450. \\n Historically, the land from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land that included modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "I_316   Between 1868 and 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, 4 individuals were removed by Dr. Joseph Jones of Nashville, TN, from sites in the State of Tennessee. Dr. Jones kept ledgers that illustrated and described many of the human remains and objects that he collected. He published the results of his excavations in Volume 22 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. In 1906, Dr. Jones\\' widow sold his collection, including the human remains from Tennessee, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred some of the crania and mandibles from Jones\\' excavations to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff of the NYU College of Dentistry. \\n The human remains under the control of the NYU College of Dentistry represent the following: One young adult male removed from an unknown site on the Harpeth River, likely in Williamson County, TN; one adult male of indeterminate age and one individual of indeterminate age and sex removed from an unknown site, TN; and one probable male adult removed from a stone grave at an unknown site, TN. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n The human remains described in this notice have been determined to be Native American through a combination of collector records, site information, and forensic data. In his catalog, Jones identifies the remains as Native American. The graves from which the human remains were removed all predate European contact, and therefore the human remains are assumed to be Native American based on their age. During forensic examination, diagnostic features of Native American individuals were identified. \\n Although the specific sites from which the remains were removed are not known, Jones excavated sites along the Cumberland and Big Harpeth Rivers in present-day Davidson and Williamson counties. The sites he excavated date to the Thruston phase (A.D. 1250-1450) and were abandoned after that time. During consultations, tribal representatives identified the area as the ancestral lands of southeastern Indian Tribes, but noted that there is difficulty in establishing a specific cultural affiliation due to the complexity of the region, broadly shared material culture, and the lack of information to trace specific migrations out of the region after A.D. 1450. \\n Historically, the area from which the human remains were removed was claimed by both the Cherokee and the Chickasaw peoples. The 1785 Treaty of Hopewell officially delineated the boundary between the Cherokee and Chickasaw lands. The Cherokee retained rights to land in modern-day Davidson County, TN, and most of modern-day Williamson County, TN. The Chickasaw retained rights to the land in the southern and western portions of modern-day Williamson County, TN. Both the Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded their lands in Davidson and/or Williamson counties, TN, to the U.S. Government in the Treaty of 1805. Without knowing the precise location of the burial sites, it is not possible to determine if the human remains were removed from the ceded lands of the Cherokee or the Chickasaw, but it is likely that they were removed from the area represented by their combined land claims in Davidson and Williamson counties. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "I_264   At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, NY. In 1926, the town of Southampton donated the human remains, which consist of the cranial fragments of one adult, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. They were accessioned into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation that same year. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, NYU College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The age of the human remains cannot be determined from the available information. Forensic examination revealed diagnostic features of an individual with Native American ancestry. Without any information about the site or age of the remains, no identifiable earlier group can be determined. \\n Shinnecock Hills, which lies near the northeastern end of Long Island, is not included in any treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders that establish aboriginal land. The area is, however, within territory that was long recognized by the tribe, the town of Southampton, and the state of New York as Shinnecock land. In 1703, the Shinnecock and town of Southampton reached an agreement in which the Shinnecock held a 1,000 year lease of approximately 3,500 acres, including Shinnecock Hills. The area was subsequently referred to as the Shinnecock Reservation in various state and local documents. The Shinnecock renegotiated their lease in 1859 and relinquished the lands at Shinnecock Hills in exchange for fee title to the land at Shinnecock Neck. The current Shinnecock Reservation, which no longer includes Shinnecock Hills, was placed into trust after the tribe was federally recognized in 2010.

The mound lies at the southern edge of aboriginal territory of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the northern edge of aboriginal territory of the Northern Valley Yokut. \\n The territorial divisions within the aboriginal lands of the Eastern (Bay and Plains) Miwok and the Northern Valley Yokut was diffuse and shifted through time. During consultation, tribal representatives stated that the early anthropological studies of the Yokuts and Miwok incorrectly divided these groups into discrete tribelets and overemphasized linguistic differences. Tribal representatives explained that although different dialects were spoken, the Miwok spoke a mutually intelligible language. The Yokuts also spoke a mutually intelligible language with regional dialects. Tribal representatives indicated that high population mobility and frequent intermarriage between groups during the historic period has resulting in a relationship of shared group identity for all Miwok tribes. Similarly, tribal representatives indicated that the Yokuts are all interrelated due to high population mobility and frequent intermarriage between groups. \\n Tribal representatives identified the descendants of the Eastern Miwok among the members of the Federally-recognized Miwok communities, including the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; California Valley Miwok Tribe, California; Chicken Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, California; Ione Band of Miwok Indians of California; Jackson Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), California; Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California; and the United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California. Tribal representatives identified the descendants of the Northern Valley Yokut among the Federally recognized Yokut tribes, including the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California. \\n    \n",
