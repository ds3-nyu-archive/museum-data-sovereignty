# Museum Studies: Data sovereignty

- PIs: Jane Anderson and Deena Engel
- Student: Alene Rhea
- Advisor: Sinclert PÃ©rez


## Project Description
Internationally, questions of ethics and equity, especially in relation to responsible sharing of data across multiple national platforms, are creating a new range of issues for researchers in the science, innovation and cultural heritage sectors. The Indigenous Data Sovereignty movement is at the forefront of asking what data ethics and equity means for Indigenous peoples. This project initiates the process of developing a means for Indigenous peoples to track and find their cultural heritage within museums, archives and libraries nationally and internationally.

Our pilot project examining over 4,000 public records on Native American cultural material from museums, libraries and archives nationally is geared towards building an Indigenous Data Detection Algorithm (IDDA) to assist Indigenous communities regain control and authority over their data, which in turn will also assist communities to locate the associated cultural materials.


## Goals
- Museum studies class will think about ethical issues (sensitive reports, ancestors information...).
- Jane will develop a protocol for thinking and sharing about information, using appropriate terms.

## Scripts and Notebooks
'Building Notices of Inventory Completion URL Dataset.ipynb' builds a dataframe with the 2467 records in the Notices of Inventory table on the National Park Service website, accessed 2/13/20. It then calls urlgetter.py to add columns for JSON and full text URLs. The final result is saved as 'inv_urls.csv.'

'Building Notices Of Repatriation Dataset.ipynb' [functional explanation]

'indexing.py' takes the index of 'inv_urls.csv,' appends each entry with 'I_,' and saves this key as a new column called 'key.' The resulting dataframe is saved to 'inv_urls.csv.' It does the same to 'repatriation_urls.csv' using 'R_' as the prefix for the key.

'main.py' takes 2 arguments, task and dataset. If the dataset argument is given as 'inventory,' the script reads in 'inv_urls.csv.' If the dataset argument is given as 'repatriation,' the script reads in 'repatriation_urls.csv.' If the task argument is given as 'fulltext,' the script passes each entry's key and full-text URL to 'downloading_fulltext.py.' If the task argument is given as 'metadata,' the script passes each entry's key and JSON URL to 'downloading_json.py.' If task is given as 'collect', and the dataset is given as 'fulltext', then downloaded JSON files from the 'fulltext' task, for both inventory and repatriation, are compiled into a single DataFrame and saved as 'fulltext.pckl.gz.' If task is given as 'collect', and the dataset is given as 'metadata', then downloaded JSON files from the 'metadata' task, for both inventory and repatriation, are compiled into a single DataFrame and saved as 'metadata.pckl.gz.' 

'downloading_metadata.py' takes in a URL and a key, and saves a JSON file with the metadata in 'datasets/downloaded_entries/metadata.'

'downloading_fulltext.py' takes in a URL and a key, and saves a JSON file with the full-text in 'datasets/downloaded_entries/fulltext.'

'data_retrieval.py' takes in a URL and returns the page's HTML.
