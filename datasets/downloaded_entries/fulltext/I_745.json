The Westmoreland-Barber site is located at river mile 429 on the Tennessee River. Archeological excavations at Westmoreland-Barber were stimulated by the TVA\\'s construction of the Nickajack Dam and the impending inundation of the resulting reservoir. In August 1964, the University of Tennessee (UT) under the direction of J.B. Graham and under contract with the National Park Service (NPS), excavated sites located within the confines of the proposed Nickajack Reservoir, including site 40MI11. A second season of excavations by UT took place from June 29 to August 18, 1965, at the Westmoreland-Barber site, under a contract with the NPS. The excavation of burial units 5 through 17 took place after the TVA completed the process of purchasing the land tracts where the burial units are located.\\n        One historic burial, burial unit 8, was excavated during the second season. Although disturbed by agricultural plowing, UT archeologists concluded at the time that the individual in the burial was laid to rest around 1775, and the remains were likely associated with the historically known 18th century Cherokee Lower Town occupation in this area. The human remains from burial unit 8 represent one adult male. No known individuals were identified.\\n        Determinations Made by the TVA and the McClung Museum\\n        Officials of TVA and the McClung Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; and the United Keetowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Federally recognized Indian tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Thomas O.
