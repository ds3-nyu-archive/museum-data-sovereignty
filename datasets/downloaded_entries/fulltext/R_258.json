The funerary objects were removed from the Burruel site, AZ AA:16:58 (ASM), which is located on private land adjacent to the San Xavier Indian Reservation, Pima County, AZ. The Burruel site was inadvertently discovered in 1979 by the property owner and excavation of human remains and funerary objects was conducted by staff from the Arizona State Museum. The human remains and funerary objects were brought to the Arizona State Museum for documentation. The funerary objects were returned to the property owner later that same year. In 1980, the property owner transferred control of the human remains to the Arizona State Museum. The human remains were reported in a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register (73 FR 8356-8357, February 13, 2008) and were subsequently repatriated. At an unknown date, the funerary objects were acquired by Dr. Peter Toma. In May 2012, Dr. Toma donated all of the funerary objects to the Arizona State Museum. The Burruel site includes at least two trash mounds and a cremation area. Ceramics associate the site with the Tanque Verde phase of the Classic period of the Hohokam Archeological tradition, dating to approximately AD 1150 to 1450.\\n\\n        Father Eusebio Kino visited the O\\'odham village of Bac in 1692 and established Mission San Xavier.
