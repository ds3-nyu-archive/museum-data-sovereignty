A reassessment of the inventory prior to repatriation revealed that some of the human remains and cultural items were removed from tribal lands prior to 1979 and were therefore not in the possession or control of the National Park Service. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs asserted control over the human remains and associated funerary objects from tribal land in 2012 and will publish a Notice of Inventory Completion addressing those remains and objects.\\n        In the Federal Register (61 FR 10009, March 12, 1996), paragraphs three through five are corrected by substituting the following paragraphs:\\n        \\n        \\n          The Monument\\'s collection of human remains represents a minimum of 54 Native American individuals and 55 associated funerary objects recovered from Hohokam sites within the Monument.\\n          Human remains recovered from Hohokam sites dating between 975-1400 A.D. within the Monument boundaries comprise a minimum of 31 individuals. No known individuals were identified. The 36 associated funerary objects are 21 jars, 5 bowls, 2 pitchers, 7 sherds, and 1 jar cover.\\n          In addition, cremations, burials, and incomplete lots of human bone representing a minimum of 23 individuals whose archeological context are unknown have also been classified as Hohokam, primarily dating to the Classic Period (1150-1400 A.D.). No known individuals were identified. The 19 associated funerary objects are 15 jars, 2 bowls, 1 sherd, and 1 bag of beads.\\n          \\n        \\n        In the Federal Register (61 FR 10009, March 12, 1996), the first two sentences of paragraph eight are corrected by substituting the following sentences:\\n        \\n        \\n          Based on the above mentioned information, and the consultation with the above mentioned tribes, officials of the National Park Service have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of 54 individuals of Native American ancestry. National Park Service officials have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the 55 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n          \\n        \\n        Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects occurred after the 30-day waiting period expired for the original March 12, 1996, Notice of Inventory Completion.
