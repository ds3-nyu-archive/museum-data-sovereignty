The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item\\n\\n        From April 27, 1938, to November 10, 1939, 1 cultural item was removed from the Cox site (1JA176), in Jackson County, AL. The Cox site was excavated as part of TVA\\'s Guntersville reservoir project by the Alabama Museum of Natural History (AMNH) at the University of Alabama, using labor and funds provided by the Works Progress Administration. Excavation of the land commenced after TVA had acquired this land for the Guntersville project. The excavation site was composed of a conical mound believed to have originally been a truncated pyramid, with multiple stratigraphic zones and also a village site containing most of the burial units. This site was occupied during the Crow Creek phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1600). Details regarding this site may be found in An Archaeological Survey of Guntersville Basin on the Tennessee River in Northern Alabama by William S. Webb and Charles G. Wilder. The unassociated funerary object excavated from the Cox site is 1 shell-tempered ceramic pot, and it has always been in the physical custody of the AMNH at the University of Alabama.\\n        This unassociated funerary object was recovered from one burial feature. The human remains from this burial feature were either not collected during excavation or have been misplaced in the last 74 years. This ceramic pot is shell-tempered and the exterior has multiple nodes. This unassociated funerary object is similar to others in use at the end of the Mississippian period.\\n        Although there is no scientific certainty that Native Americans of the Crow Creek phase are directly related to modern Federally recognized tribes, Spanish explorers of the 16th centuries do indicate the presence of chiefdom level tribal entities in the southeastern United States. The Coosa paramount chiefdom noted in historical chronicles is the most likely entity related to Crow Creek sites in this part of the Guntersville Reservoir. Tribal groups or towns now part of The Muscogee (Creek) Nation claim descent from the Coosa chiefdom. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that in this part of the Guntersville Reservoir area, Crow Creek phase sites are most likely culturally associated with groups now part of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Determinations Made by the Tennessee Valley Authority\\n        Officials of TVA have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 1 cultural item described in this notice is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and is believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary object and The Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Federally recognized Indian tribe not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Dr. Thomas O.
