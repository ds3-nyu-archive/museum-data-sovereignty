The 105 unassociated funerary objects are 14 pottery and ceramic fragments, 30 jewelry items and fragments, 2 pollen samples, 2 faunal bone fragments, 51 projectile points, and 6 tools and implements. The cultural items are associated with seven features identified by the field archeologists as secondary human cremations.

Archeological evidence indicates that the Cashion site (NA14690), within the Salt River area of central Arizona, was occupied during the period A.D. 700-900 by the Hohokam people, for whom cremation was a common mortuary practice. Hopi and Zuni oral traditions also indicate that segments of the prehistoric Hohokam population migrated to areas occupied by the ancestors of the Hopi and Zuni and were assimilated into the resident populations. Archeological, historical, and oral tradition evidence indicate that there is a relationship of shared group identity between the Hohokam people and the present-day Piman and O\\'odham cultures, represented by the Ak-Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Determinations Made by the Museum of Northern Arizona\\n\\n        Officials of the Museum of Northern Arizona have determined that:\\n        \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 105 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony, and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Ak-Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Elaine Hughes, Museum of Northern Arizona, 3101 North Fort Valley Road, Flagstaff, AZ 86001, telephone (928) 774-5211 x228, email ehughes@musnaz.org, by June 2, 2017.\\n        After that date, if no additional claimants have come forward, transfer of control of the unassociated funerary objects to the Ak-Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico may proceed.\\n        The Museum of Northern Arizona is responsible for notifying the Ak-Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: March 22, 2017.\\n          Melanie O\\'Brien,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 2017-08859 Filed 5-2-17; 8:45 am]\\n       BILLING CODE 4312-52-P\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service", "dep_doc": "[NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-23135; PPWOCRADN0-PCU00RP14.R50000]", "subject": "Notice of Intent To Repatriate Cultural Items: Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff, AZ", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.", "action": "Notice.", "summary": "The Museum of Northern Arizona, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, has determined that the cultural items listed in this notice meet the definition of unassociated funerary objects.
