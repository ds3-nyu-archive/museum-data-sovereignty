The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Thomas Lucky Site (SUBi-888), Town of Ashland, Chemung County, NY.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Binghamton University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cayuga Nation; Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Delaware Tribe of Indians; Oneida Nation (previously listed as the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin); Oneida Indian Nation (previously listed as the Oneida Nation of New York); Onondaga Nation; Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (previously listed as the St. Regis Band of Mohawk Indians of New York); Seneca Nation of Indians (previously listed as the Seneca Nation of New York); Seneca-Cayuga Nation (previously listed as the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma); Stockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin; Tonawanda Band of Seneca (previously listed as the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York); and Tuscarora Nation.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1994-1995, following consultation with a chief from the Onondaga Nation, human remains representing two individuals were removed from the Thomas Lucky site in Town of Elmira, Chemung County, NY, by the Binghamton University field school. One associated funerary object, a broken white bone bead, was found with the human remains.\\n        A bioarcheologist and archeologist from Binghamton University determined that the human remains were Native American. No known individuals were identified. Archeological information shows that two longhouses were present at the site, one with AMS dates extending from A.D. 1300 to 1450 and one with dates extending into the A.D. 1600s. Pottery at the site supports this continuous span of land use. This region was home to Delaware communities during the eighteenth century, and both the Delaware and Seneca engaged in Revolutionary War battles fought nearby as part of the Sullivan-Clinton campaign.\\n        Haudenosaunee oral tradition states that, as The People of the Long House, they are affiliated culturally, spiritually, biologically, and personally to the ancestors located within their traditional aboriginal territories. This connection is also based upon cultural practices, language, and the philosophy of respect for those ancestors that have passed. This evidence supports a relationship of shared group identity which can reasonably be traced between the Cayuga Nation of New York; Seneca Nation of New York; Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma; and Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York and the human remains removed from the Thomas Luckey site, as this location is within the traditional aboriginal territory of the Cayuga Nation; Seneca Nation of Indians (previously listed as the Seneca Nation of New York); Seneca-Cayuga Nation (previously listed as the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma); and Tonawanda Band of Seneca (previously listed as the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York).
