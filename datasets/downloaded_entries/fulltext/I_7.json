Culin was leading a collecting expedition to the American West for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology funded by John Wanamaker, a Philadelphia businessman and philanthropist. From 1900 to 1915, the human remains were housed at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. On January 11, 1915, the human remains were donated to the Wistar Institute of Philadelphia (15525 and 15526). The human remains were transferred to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology on a long-term loan in 1956 (L-1011-54 and L-1011-211), where they are currently housed. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The physical condition of the human remains and the collector\\'s description about the circumstance surrounding their removal indicate that the remains were of relatively recent historical origin at the time of removal. The human remains have been identified as Native American based on the specific cultural and geographic attribution identified in Museum records.
