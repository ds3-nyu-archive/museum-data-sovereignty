The Tribes do not object to the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects described in this notice to the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1973, human remains representing a minimum of eight individuals were removed from the Gyftakis site (20MK51), St. Ignace, Moran Township, Mackinac County, MI, during an archeological excavation directed by Dr. James Fitting. Middle Woodland period ceramic sherds were found during test excavations for the St. Ignace Archaeological Survey Project, which prompted further archeological research. The burials were found to be in good condition. The human remains were transferred to Western Michigan University for curation and further analysis by Dr. Robert Sundick, a physical anthropologist in the Anthropology Department at Western Michigan University. No known individuals were identified. The 20 associated funerary objects are 8 black bear scapula and fragments, 1 black bear atlas, 1 black bear proximal femur head, 1 large bird long bone shaft, 1 possible black bear phalanx, 1 possible crane carpometacarpus, 1 raptor carpometacarpus, 1 possible small bird long bone, 1 unidentified non-human cranium fragment, 2 bird or small mammal long bones, and 2 probable bird phalanxes.\\n\\n        Native American ancestry was determined based on skeletal and dental morphology, as well as the temporal association of the Gyftakis Site to the Middle Woodland period (A.D. 170). Radiocarbon dating of a sample from an associated hearth and AMS date of ceramic pot residue, as well as seriation of the pottery and lithic tools discovered at the Gyftakis site which were not associated funerary objects, are all indicative of the Middle Woodland period and are clearly of pre-Contact/European manufacturing.\\n        \\n        Determinations Made by Western Michigan University, Department of Anthropology\\n        Officials of Western Michigan University, Department of Anthropology, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Based on skeletal and dental morphology, in addition to radiocarbon and AMS dating, and other artifacts which all demonstrate a Middle Woodland temporal association, the human remains are Native American.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Multiple lines of evidence, such as the Treaty of Saginaw 1819 (also known as the Treaty with the Chippewa of 1819), continued occupation of the area, and oral tradition, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of eight individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 20 objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains is to the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects or any other Indian tribe that believes it satisfies the criteria in 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1) should contact LouAnn Wurst, Department of Anthropology, Western Michigan University, 1005 Moore Hall, Kalamazoo, MI 49008, telephone (269) 387-2753, before July 21, 2011.
