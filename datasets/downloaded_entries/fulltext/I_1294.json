In 1893, human remains representing a minimum of six individuals from that removal were purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History from Ward\\'s Natural Science Establishment of Rochester, NY (Field Museum of Natural History catalog numbers 42700-42703, accession number 407). The human remains were accessioned into the Field Museum of Natural History the same year. No known individuals were identified.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains have been identified as Native American, based on craniometric analysis and the specific cultural and geographic attribution in Field Museum of Natural History records. Archeological investigations have identified a cultural continuity for the Chumash Indians that traces their presence on the northern Channel Islands back 7,000 to 9,000 years. Geographical, archeological, and oral history evidence indicate a shared group identity between these human remains from San Miguel, San Nicolas, and Santa Catalina Islands and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians of the Santa Ynez Reservation, California, the present-day tribe most closely associated with the prehistoric and historic Chumash Indians.\\n        Officials of the Field Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above are reasonably believed to be the physical remains of 14 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Field Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians of the Santa Ynez Reservation, California.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Helen Robbins, Repatriation Director, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 S. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605, telephone (312) 665-7317, before February 4, 2010.
