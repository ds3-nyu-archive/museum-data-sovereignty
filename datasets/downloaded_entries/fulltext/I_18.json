Burial #1-D consists of the skeletal human remains of an adult male\\'s mandible with much of the mandibular body missing. The human remains were analyzed by T.M.J. Mulinski and Dr. Walter Birkby from the Arizona State Museum, Human Identification Laboratory in 1971. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        From 1969 to 1971, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from site AZ:FF:7:2 (the San Bernardino site), in Cochise County, AZ, as part of a Cochise College archeological field school. Burial #1 is the incomplete skeleton of a male, 30-40 years old. Burial #2 is the flexed incomplete skeleton of a female, approximately 25 years old. Burial #3 is the flexed incomplete skeleton of a male, 20-35 years old. No known individuals were identified.\\n        In 1970, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site AZ:EE:12:1 in Cochise County, AZ, by an unknown individual. The burial contained the extended, incomplete skeletal remains of a female, 18-24 years old. This individual had previously been removed from a Preceramic site on state land in Cochise County leased to the S O Ranch. No known individual was identified.\\n        In 1970, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site AZ:CC:15:1, Chiricahua Cave in the Colorado National Forest in Cochise County, AZ. The human remains were found by weekend explorers. In 1970, portions of a human skull and mandible, plus other bones, were given to Cochise College. No known individual was identified.\\n        Sometime before 1970, human remains representing, at minimum one individual were removed from an unknown location in Cochise County, AZ. The human remains\\xe2\\x80\\x94a small amount of calcined human bones\\xe2\\x80\\x94were enclosed in a burial urn. A local rancher found this pot (tentatively identified as Pantano Red on Brown) on the surface, just east of the Mule Mountains in the Sulphur Springs Valley, and donated it to Cochise College in 1970. No known individual was identified. The one associated funerary object is the burial urn.\\n\\n        Sometime before 1970, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown location in Cochise County, AZ. The human remains, labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKambitch Bones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d appear to have been given to Cochise College in 1970 from a ranch located northeast of Douglas, AZ. No known individual was identified.
