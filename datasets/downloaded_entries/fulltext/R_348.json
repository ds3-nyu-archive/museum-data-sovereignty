Officials of the Rochester Museum & Science Center have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the 306 cultural items described above are objects having an ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.  Lastly, officials of the Rochester Museum & Science Center have determined, that pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects/objects of cultural patrimony and the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian Nation or tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the sacred objects/objects of cultural patrimony should contact Adele DeRosa, NAGPRA Coordinator/Collections Manager, Rochester Museum & Science Center, 657 East Ave., Rochester, NY 14607, telephone (585) 271-4552, ext 302, before July 28, 2010.
