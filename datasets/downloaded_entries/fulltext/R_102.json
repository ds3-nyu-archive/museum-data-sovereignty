The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In 1979, 1983, and 1986, 27 cultural items were removed from the Belle Meade site (3CT30) in Crittenden County, AR. These unassociated funerary objects were recovered by the University of Memphis in 1979, 1983, and 1986, and were curated at the C.H. Nash Museum in Memphis, TN. These cultural items were transferred to the Arkansas Archeological Survey in December of 2015. The 27 unassociated funerary objects are 10 partial jars, 5 fragmentary bottles, 1 frog effigy, 10 reconstructed bowls, and 1 reconstructed Ogee bowl (Catalog #2016-551, 552, 553, 554, 555, and 556).\\n        At an unknown date, 10 cultural items were removed from the Belle Meade site (3CT30) in Crittenden County, AR. These unassociated funerary objects were donated to the C.H. Nash Museum in Memphis, TN, part of the University of Memphis. These cultural items were transferred to the Arkansas Archeological Survey in December of 2015. The 10 unassociated funerary objects are 1 reconstructed bowl, 1 fragmentary bottle, 5 fragmentary jar, 2 large bag of sherds, and 1 partial Ogee short necked bottle (Catalog # 2016-556, 557).\\n        In 1980 and 1983, 22 cultural items were removed from the Beck site (3CT8) in Crittenden County, AR. These unassociated funerary objects were recovered by the University of Memphis and curated at the C.H. Nash Museum in Memphis, TN. These cultural items were transferred to the Arkansas Archeological Survey in December of 2015. The 22 unassociated funerary objects include 5 reconstructed jars, 1 wide-mouthed bottle, 2 reconstructed effigy bowls, 4 fragmentary bottles, 1 effigy jar, 6 fragmentary bowls, 2 fragmentary jars, and 1 fragmentary teapot vessel (Catalog #2016-473, 477).\\n        The items detailed in this inventory represent late prehistoric and protohistoric items common to large village sites located in the central Mississippi Valley province of northeastern Arkansas. It is difficult to link historic ethnic identities to prehistoric cultural manifestations identified for this region solely on the basis of archeological evidence. In response to this circumstance, modern Native American communities assert cultural affiliations for the purpose of NAGPRA repatriation claims based on settlement locations at the beginning of the Colonial era as documented by early European accounts. Colonial records from the late 17th century and extending through the 18th century place Quapaws in the region encompassed by the modern counties from which the collections listed above are derived.
