Records indicate the four items were removed from cremation burials, though the human remains are not present. The objects are two ceramic bowls, one ceramic scoop, and one shell bracelet.\\n        Between 1927 and 1928, one unassociated funerary object was removed by the Gila Pueblo Foundation from the Adamsville site (Florence 7: 6 (GP); AZ U:15:1 [ASM]) in Pinal County, AZ. Records indicate that this item likely was associated with a cremation burial, although no specific burial is listed. The object is one ceramic bowl.\\n\\n        In 1940, the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology received these five unassociated funerary objects as part of an exchange with the Gila Pueblo Foundation. Archaeological evidence indicates the sites of Adamsville and Pozos de Sonoqui are from the archeologically defined Hohokam tradition. The occupation of the Adamsville site was approximately between A.D. 900 and 1450. The occupation of the Pozos de Sonoqui site was approximately between A.D. 950 and 1450. Mortuary practices, ethnographic materials, and technology indicate a cultural affiliation of these Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman) and Puebloan cultures. An August 2000 cultural affiliation study, submitted by the Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona, addresses continuities between the Hohokam and the O\\'odham tribes.\\n        Determinations Made by the Robert S.
