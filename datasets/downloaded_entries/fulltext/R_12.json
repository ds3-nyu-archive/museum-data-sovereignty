These objects were part of a 1994 donation from the estate of Dorothy Zama May of La Jolla, CA, who was an avid enthusiast of American Indian cultures and traditions of the Southwest United States. The May family traveled throughout the Southwest U.S. and Southern California collecting American Indian art and other objects. The 13 objects of cultural patrimony are one set of bone whistle fragments; two stone pendants; one miniature stone pestle; one stone slab with pictograph; two stone figures; five ceramic pipes; and one stone pipe or sucking tube.\\n        San Diego County is recognized as the aboriginal area of the people of the Kumeyaay Nation and all 13 bands of the Kumeyaay Nation were invited to consult. During consultations with representatives of the Jamul Indian Village of California of the Kumeyaay Nation, tribal members recognized these objects as having been important to their village members, and spoke of how they were used both in the past and present. They related stories of learning about objects similar to these from tribal members.
