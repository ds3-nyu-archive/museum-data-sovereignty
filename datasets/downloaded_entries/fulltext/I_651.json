Their son discovered the remains when settling his parents\\' estate and was put in touch with the Montezuma County Coroner, who ruled out a forensic interest in the human remains October 2014. The remains were then transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSAC), where they are identified as Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 307. Osteological analysis by Nicholas Zell of Metropolitan State University indicates that the human remains are likely of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Sometime in the 1950s, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a farm near Cortez, CO, by a private citizen. His wife discovered them among her late husband\\'s possessions. In September 2014, she turned them over to the Montezuma County Coroner, who ruled out forensic interest in the human remains. In January 2015, the remains were transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSAC), where they are identified as Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 308. Osteological analysis by Christiane Baigent of Metropolitan State University indicates that the human remains are likely of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        History Colorado, in partnership with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, conducted tribal consultations among the tribes with ancestral ties to the State of Colorado to develop the process for disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from inadvertent discoveries on Colorado State and private lands. As a result of the consultation, a process was developed, Process for Consultation, Transfer, and Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating From Inadvertent Discoveries on Colorado State and Private Lands, (2008, unpublished, on file with the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation). The tribes consulted are those who have expressed their wishes to be notified of discoveries in the Southwest and Basin and Plateau Consultation Regions as established by the Process, where these individuals originated.\\n\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. On November 3-4, 2006, the Process was presented to the Review Committee for consideration. A January 8, 2007, letter on behalf of the Review Committee from the Designated Federal Officer transmitted the provisional authorization to proceed with the Process upon receipt of formal responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, subject to forthcoming conditions imposed by the Secretary of the Interior. On May 15-16, 2008, the responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma were submitted to the Review Committee. On September 23, 2008, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, as the designee for the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains according to the Process and NAGPRA, pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.
