The human remains were removed from Los Angeles County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Southwest Museum of the American Indian, Autry National Center professional staff in consultation with representatives of the San Manuel Band of Serrano Mission Indians of the San Manuel Reservation, California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California (also known as the Tachi Yokut Tribe); Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation of California; and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California.\\n        In 1938, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals were removed from an unknown site near Lancaster, Antelope Valley, Los Angeles County, CA, by the Sheriff\\'s Office in Newhall, CA. The Sheriff\\'s Office turned the human remains over to the Coroner\\'s Office. The human remains were donated to the museum by Frank A. Nance, of the Coroner\\'s Office in Los Angeles, CA. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Based on archeological analysis, the individuals have been identified as Native American, but the age is unknown. Consultation with a representative of the Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California, confirmed that the provenience of the human remains is consistent with that of other discoveries of indigenous remains in the area. Geographical and historical evidence indicates that the sites are located within the traditional territory of the Southern Valley Yokuts and the Serrano people. Descendants of the Southern Valley Yokuts and the Serrano people are members of the San Manuel Band of Serrano Mission Indians of the San Manuel Reservation, California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation of California; and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California.\\n        Officials of the Southwest Museum of the American Indian, Autry National Center have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Southwest Museum of the American Indian, Autry National Center also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the San Manuel Band of Serrano Mission Indians of the San Manuel Reservation, California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation of California; and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Duane H. King, Ph.D., Executive Director, or LaLena Lewark, Senior NAGPRA Coordinator, Southwest Museum of the American Indian, 234 Museum Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90065, (323) 221-2164, extension 241, before October 22, 2007.
