TVA acquired this site on October 9, 1934, for the Wheeler Reservoir project. This site was 350 feet long and 200 feet wide. Although described as a mound, it appears to have been an accumulation of shell, midden debris and natural floodplain soils, rather than intentionally constructed earthen works. No structures were identified, but there were multiple hearths, midden-filled pits and human burials. There are no radiocarbon dates for this site. Recovered artifacts suggest multiple occupations including Late Archaic (4000-1000 B.C.), Early Woodland (1000-500 B.C.), Middle Woodland Copena Phase (A.D. 100-500), Late Woodland (A.D. 500-1000) and Mississippian (A.D. 1200-1500) periods.\\n        The human remains include adults, juveniles, children, and infants of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. The 35 associated funerary objects include one Bell Plain effigy bowl; 11 bone beads; two bone ornaments; one copper earring; two copper ornaments; one copper pendant; nine copper tubular beads; one cordage; one deer antler figurine; one limestone pipe; one McKee Island Brushed jar; one Mississippi Plain bowl; one Mississippi Plain jar; one piece of red ocher; and one shell cup.\\n        At some time during the 1950s, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from site 1LI22 in Limestone County, AL, by James Cambron.

TVA acquired this site on December 11, 1934, for the Wheeler Reservoir project, but no formal excavations were conducted. Site 1LI45 was described as a shell midden along the original levee of the Tennessee River. Artifacts from this site indicate occupation from the Late Archaic to the Late Woodland. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        At some time during the 1950s, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from site 1LI46 in Limestone County, AL, by James Cambron. TVA acquired this site on December 11, 1934, for the Wheeler Reservoir project, but no formal excavations were conducted.

The human remains include two 30-40 years old males and one 20-30 year old of unknown sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At some time during the 1950s, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from site 1LI50 in Limestone County, AL, by James Cambron. TVA acquired this site on July 25, 1935, for the Wheeler Reservoir project, but no formal excavations were conducted. Site 1LI50 was described as a shell midden. Artifacts suggest a Late Archaic to Early Woodland occupation. The human remains include one 17-19 year old female and an adult female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At some time during the 1950s, human remains representing, at minimum, seven individuals were removed from site 1LI51 in Limestone County, AL, by James Cambron. TVA acquired this site on December 20, 1934, for the Wheeler Reservoir project, but no formal excavations were conducted. Site 1LI51 was described as a shell midden. Artifacts suggest occupations during the Late Archaic, Middle Woodland and Late Woodland. The human remains include three 30-50 year old males; one 40-50 year old female, and three juveniles of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        From February through March 1934, human remains representing, at minimum, 25 individuals were removed from site 1MA4, in Madison County, AL, by AMNH. TVA acquired a strip of land around the periphery of Hobbs Island encompassing this site on May 23, 1939 as part of the Wheeler Reservoir project, but the excavation was conducted with Federal funds in anticipation of the inundation of this site. The site was a shell midden 300 x 125 feet and adjacent to the island\\'s shoreline. There are no radiocarbon dates available for this site, but artifacts from a non-mortuary context suggest Langston (A.D. 900-1200) and Hobbs Island (A.D. 1200-1450) phase occupations. The human remains include infants, adolescents, and adults of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects.\\n        From March 1940 to July 1941, human remains representing, at minimum, nine individuals were removed from site 1MA31/1MA32 in Madison County, AL. TVA acquired this site on July 6, 1936, for the Wheeler Reservoir project. 1MA31 and 1MA32 are now considered one multi-mound and village site. The site was composed of one small conical mound; a 200 x 1000 foot village area and a large mound 10 feet in height and 75 x 105 feet at the base. These mounds were domiciliary, rather than mortuary, in nature. Unfortunately, both mounds had suffered from looting prior to excavation. Recent radiocarbon dates of animal bone from a non-mortuary context have a calibrated two-sigma range of A.D. 1050-1275, indicating an occupation from the early to middle Mississippian period. The human remains are in a fragmentary state, making it impossible to determine sex, but most of the individuals appear to be adults over the age of eighteen. No known individuals were identified.
