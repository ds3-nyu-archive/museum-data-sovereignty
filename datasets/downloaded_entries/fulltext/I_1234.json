The human remains were removed from an unknown location.\\n\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by New York University College of Dentistry professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations).\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from an unknown location. The human remains were acquired by Dr. Joseph Jones of Louisiana at an unknown date. In 1906, the widow of Dr. Jones sold his collection to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. In 1956, the Museum of the American Indian transferred the human remains to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, New York University College of Dentistry. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Museum records indicate that the human remains are from an unknown location, and are the human remains of a Seminole individual whose last name was Tigertail. This name is a known surname among the Seminole. The identification of a surname and tribal affiliation indicates that the human remains date to post-Contact times. Although a surname is listed for the individual, lineal descendants could not be identified because the full name of the individual could not be determined. Despite the inability to determine lineal descendants, no information from the museum records, osteological assessment, or consultation conflicts with the identification of the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeminole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d During consultations, tribal representatives supported the identification of the human remains as Seminole. Today, descendants of the Seminole are members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida. \\n        Officials of New York University College of Dentistry have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of New York University College of Dentistry also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Louis Terracio, New York University College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th St., New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9917, before September 23, 2010. Repatriation of the human remains to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The New York University College of Dentistry is responsible for notifying the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: August 18, 2010.\\n          David Tarler, \\n          Acting Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 2010-20949 Filed 8-23-10; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4312-50-S\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion: New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.", "action": "Notice.", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Dated: August 18, 2010.", "signature_name": "David Tarler, ", "signature_title": "Acting Manager, National NAGPRA Program.", "fr_doc": "[FR Doc. 2010-20949 Filed 8-23-10; 8:45 am]", "billing_code": "BILLING CODE 4312-50-S", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
