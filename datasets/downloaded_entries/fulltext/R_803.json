Barrett, Curator of \\nAnthropology at the Milwaukee Public Museum, collected this mask at \\nOrayvi, Third Mesa, in Arizona. There is no accession information \\nconcerning the actual acquisition of this mask. \\n    Authorized representatives of the Hopi Tribe acting on behalf of \\nthe Parrot Clan of Orayvi have identified the mask as an object having \\nongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the \\nHopi Tribe. Further, consultation evidence presented by tribal \\nrepresentatives indicate this mask is the communal property of the \\nvillage of Orayvi, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or \\nconveyed by any individual. This consultation evidence is further \\nsupported by other written ethnographic documentation regarding this \\nmask. \\n    Officials of the Milwaukee Public Museum have determined that, \\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(D), this cultural item has ongoing \\nhistorical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the culture \\nitself, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by \\nany individual. Officials of the Milwaukee Public Museum have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these items and the Hopi Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hopi Tribe. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these objects should contact Ann McMullen, \\nPh.D., Curator of North American Ethnology, Milwaukee Public Museum, \\n800 West Wells St., Milwaukee, WI 53233, telephone (414) 278-2786, fax \\n(414) 278-6100, before August 26, 1996. Repatriation of these objects \\nto the Hopi tribe may begin after that date if no additional claimants \\ncome forward.\\n\\nDated: July 23, 1996.\\nFrancis P.
