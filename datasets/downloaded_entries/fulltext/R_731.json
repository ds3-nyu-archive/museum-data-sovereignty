In 1970, the other two\\n\\n[[Page 51786]]\\n\\nkwatsi were purchased by The Children\\'s Museum from William Bailey of \\nNew Mexico.\\n    Museum records indicate these cultural items are all Katsina kwatsi \\n(masks). Museum documentation indicates two of the kwatsi are Zuni. \\nHowever, consultation with representatives of the Zuni Tribe of the \\nZuni Reservation in 1982 indicated that the two kwatsi are not Zuni. \\nMuseum documentation for the remaining two kwatsi indicates they are \\nHopi. Consultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe indicate that \\nall four Katsina kwatsi are Hopi; and the kwatsi are regarded as sacred \\nobjects needed by the Katsinmomngwit (Katsina Chiefs) of the Hopi Tribe \\nin the Hopi villages for the practice of traditional Hopi religion.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of The \\nChildren\\'s Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(3), \\nthese four cultural items are specific ceremonial objects needed by \\ntraditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. \\nOfficials of the The Children\\'s Museum have also determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the \\nHopi Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hopi Tribe and the \\nZuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation. Representatives of any other Indian \\ntribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these \\nobjects should contact Joan Lester, Native American Curator, The \\nChildren\\'s Museum, 300 Congress Street, Boston, MA 02210-1034; \\ntelephone: (617) 426-6500 before October 25, 1999. Repatriation of \\nthese objects to the Hopi Tribe may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: September 14, 1999.\\nVeletta Canouts,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nDeputy Manager, Archeology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 99-24856 Filed 9-23-99; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
