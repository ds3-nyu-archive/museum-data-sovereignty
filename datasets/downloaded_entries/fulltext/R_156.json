The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item(s)\\n        At an unknown date prior to 1943, 116 cultural items were removed from gravesites associated with the Ojibwa/Chippewa and Odawa/Ottawa Village and Cemetery/Ossuary site (20MK3), located on Round Island in Mackinac County, MI. Mr. Harvey E. Bouwknegt (1888-1967) of Grandville, MI, donated the Bouwknegt (Bowknegtt, or Brouwknect) Collection to the Chicago Natural History Museum (later renamed the Field Museum of Natural History), where the cultural items were accessioned in 1943.\\n        Round Island is located within Royce Area 205, which was ceded to the U.S. Government by the Ottawa and Chippewa Tribes of Michigan in the 1836 Treaty of Washington. Under Article 3 of this treaty, Round Island is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca place of encampment for the Indians, to be under the charge of the Indian department.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In 1873, the U.S. Government set aside 8.24 acres of land on Round Island for the construction of a lighthouse, and in 1875, deeded the remainder of the island, including the location of site 20MK3, to the State of Michigan for the creation of a state park. A state park was never created, however, and so the ownership of the island reverted to the Federal government in 1935, and Round Island was established as National Forest Land in 1938.\\n        The 116 objects in the Bouwknegt Collection, therefore, were more than likely removed from site 20MK3 during the period when the island was owned by the State of Michigan (1875-1935). The Michigan State Historic Preservation office, however, has formally deferred its responsibilities as the lead agency to the Hiawatha National Forest for this repatriation case.\\n        The 116 unassociated funerary objects consist of 10 buckles, 39 links, 2 silver gorgets, 7 silver armbands, 4 silver bracelets, 1 silver Maltese cross, 1 silver Latin cross, 1 silver Florentine cross, 21 silver brooches, 1 silver hair tube, 2 silver beaver effigies, 1 silver breast ornament, 5 silver breast ornament pieces, 1 silver ornament, 15 silver earrings, and 5 beads. The Field Museum catalog numbers for these items are 47832-47838, 47840-47843, 47845-47870, 47872, 47873, and 47875. Sixteen of the silver trade items have maker\\'s marks stamped on them that roughly date between1760 and 1810. These objects and the other items in the Bouwknegt Collection are comparable to silver trade items recovered from contemporary Ojibwa and Odawa village sites and cemeteries located throughout Michigan and the Upper Great Lakes.\\n        Twenty-one tribes (see list below) were consulted through a combination of formal letters, emails, and phone conversations to determine the disposition of these cultural items. Seven formally expressed their support for repatriating the Bouwknegt Collection to the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians who submitted the formal claim to repatriate this collection. The remaining fourteen tribes did not formally respond to our invitation to comment. None, however, expressed concern or disapproval.\\n        Determinations Made by the Hiawatha National Forest\\n        Officials of the Hiawatha National Forest have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 116 unassociated funerary objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Sault Ste.
