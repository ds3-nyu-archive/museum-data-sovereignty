The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from a site at Lake Texoma, in Bryan County, OK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was originally made by the SNOMNH professional staff, and more recently by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, professional staff, in consultation with representatives of The Chickasaw Nation.\\n        \\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1941, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Opel Site (34BR4) in Bryan County, OK. The site was excavated as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project and the collection was deposited at the Stovall Museum (now SNOMNH). Although SNOMNH originally consulted on the collection and have physical custody of the human remains and associated funerary objects, the collection was recently determined to be under the control of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District. The human remains represent one child from Burial 1 and one adult from Burial 2. No known individuals were identified. The 70 associated funerary objects are from two separate burials. The 58 associated funerary objects from Burial 1 are 9 saucers, bowls, and plates; 3 ceramic cups; 5 spoons; 2 shoes; 1 iron cup; 1 lot of iron pail fragments; 1 china bowl; 1 broken glass; 1 small glass bottle; 1 lot of iron pieces; 29 small beads; 2 thimbles; 1 fork; and 1 knife. The 12 associated funerary objects from Burial 2 are 1 bead, 1 worked stone, 1 iron buckle, 2 glass disks, and 7 buttons.\\n        Based on the types of materials found at the Opel Site including the associated funerary objects, it is reasonable to determine that the burials are historic and date to the late 19th century. At the time the burials were excavated in 1941, local residents could not recall a house being at that location and the site had been cultivated for approximately 40 years. The region in which the site is located was designated Chickasaw Territory in 1837, and historic documents and oral histories of the Chickasaw provide additional support that the region was occupied by their tribe during the 19th century. Consultation with representatives of The Chickasaw Nation confirms that the associated funerary objects are the types and quantities of materials that are found with Chickasaw burials from this time period.\\n        Determinations Made by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District\\n        Officials of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 70 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and The Chickasaw Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Michelle C.
