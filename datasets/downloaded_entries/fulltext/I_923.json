In June 2012, the human remains were found in a private home in Mesa County, CO, and were turned over to law enforcement authorities. The private citizen had previously lived in several cities in Colorado, including Alamosa, Durango, Cory, and Whitewater. Subsequently, the Mesa County Coroner ruled out a forensic interest in the human remains and turned them over to the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSAC), where they are identified as Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 289. Osteological analysis by Dr. Catherine Gaither indicates that the human remains are consistent with archaeological materials and are likely of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. Pottery sherds and fossils were found in the box with the remains, but their relationship to the remains is unknown, and they are not considered associated funerary objects.\\n        In June 2012, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were found by a highway survey worker between two rocks at the side of the road. The worker contacted the Park County Sheriff who, along with the Park County Coroner, ruled out a forensic interest in the human remains. Osteological analysis by Dr. Catherine Gaither indicates the remains are consistent with archaeological materials and are likely of Native American ancestry. The remains were transferred to the OSAC, where they are identified as OAHP Case Number 291. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        History Colorado, in partnership with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, conducted tribal consultations among the tribes with ancestral ties to the State of Colorado to develop the process for disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from inadvertent discoveries on Colorado State and private lands. As a result of the consultation, a process was developed, Process for Consultation, Transfer, and Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating From Inadvertent Discoveries on Colorado State and Private Lands, (2008, unpublished, on file with the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation). The tribes consulted are those who have ancestral ties to Colorado, based on the limited provenience information.\\n\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. On November 3-4, 2006, the Process was presented to the Review Committee for consideration. A January 8, 2007, letter on behalf of the Review Committee from the Designated Federal Officer transmitted the provisional authorization to proceed with the Process upon receipt of formal responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, subject to forthcoming conditions imposed by the Secretary of the Interior. On May 15-16, 2008, the responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma were submitted to the Review Committee. On September 23, 2008, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, as the designee for the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains according to the Process and NAGPRA, pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement.\\n\\n        43 CFR 10.11 was promulgated on March 15, 2010, to provide a process for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains recovered from tribal or aboriginal lands as established by the final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or U.S. Court of Claims, a treaty, Act of Congress, or Executive Order, or other authoritative governmental sources.
