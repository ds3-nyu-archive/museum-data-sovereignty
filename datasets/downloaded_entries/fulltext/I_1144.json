Traditional Cherokee burials are found in rock crevices and caves; traditional Cherokee burials include non-human bones such as the sharpened rib bones found with this burial.

The associated funerary objects are two bear teeth.\\n        This individual was part of the Hoofnagle collection sold to the University of Colorado Museum in March 1961.
