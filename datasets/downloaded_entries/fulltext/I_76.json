The human remains were found inside a rock shelter; caliche stones covered the mouth of the burial. The individual appears to be a young female, 13-15 years old. The human remains were placed in a flexed position on the right side, facing southwest towards the entrance of the rock shelter. Portions of the skeleton were missing, including the pelvis and most of the vertebrae, due to rodent disturbance. No known individuals were identified. The eight associated funerary objects are one whelk shell axe, three elk-tooth pendants, one brass buckle, one cinch buckle, one lump of blue-green pigment, and one textile. (One iron axe and 3,638 glass beads (403 white seed beads, 3,100 light blue beads, 131 dark blue beads, two green beads, and two donut-shaped beads) associated with this burial are currently missing from the collection. These items were transferred to an unknown location in Austin, TX, in March 1967, and efforts to find them have been unsuccessful.)\\n        The Morgan Jones site dates from A.D. 1790 to the early 1800s, based on the brass cinch buckle found with the burial. According to correspondence from Curtis Tunnell (then the Texas State Archeologist), the brass cinch buckle is of Spanish-Mexican origin, and dates to the early 1800s. The plain brass buckle and axe are English or French. Based on the associated funerary objects, the cultural affiliation is definitively identified as Comanche.\\n        Determinations Made by the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University\\n        Officials of the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the eight objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to B.
