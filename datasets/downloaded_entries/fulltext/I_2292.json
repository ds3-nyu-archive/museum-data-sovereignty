In 1965, these human remains were donated to the \\nDelta County Historical Society. No known individuals were identified. \\nThe two associated funerary objects include a cradleboard of willow \\nconstruction and a woven grass mat.\\n\\n[[Page 29067]]\\n\\n    Based on the manner of interment, the associated funerary objects, \\nand the condition of the remains, this individual has been identified \\nas Native American from the historic period. Prior to 1881, the site \\nfrom which the human remains were recovered was a known grave area of \\nthe Uncompahgre Band of the Ute Nation. After 1881, all Ute Bands \\nrelocated to their present reservations. No other Indian tribes are \\nknown to have inhabited the Uncompahgre Valley during the historic \\nperiod.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Delta \\nCounty Historical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Delta \\nCounty Historical Society have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(2), the two objects listed above are reasonably believed to \\nhave been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of \\ndeath or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials \\nof the Delta County Historical Society have determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity \\nwhich can be reasonably traced between these Native American human \\nremains and associated funerary objects and the Ute Indian Tribe of the \\nUnitah and Ouray Reservation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Ute Indian Tribe of \\nthe Unitah and Ouray Reservation, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute \\nMountain Reservation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact James K. Wetzel, \\nCurator, Delta County Historical Society Museum, 251 Meeker Street, \\nDelta, CO; telephone: (970) 874-8721, before June 28, 1999. \\nRepatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to \\nthe Ute Indian Tribe of the Unitah and Ouray Reservation may begin \\nafter that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: May 13, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
