The human remains, designated as AHUR 142 (also referred to as AHUR 142X), were collected by Mr. Robert Hopkins and subsequently given to Dr. Sheilagh Brooks, an anthropologist in the Department of Anthropology at UNLV. They consist of the mostly complete mummified remains of an infant between 0 and 12 months old. No known individuals were identified. The four associated funerary objects are a necklace of tubular bone beads found around the left arm and neck, wooden sticks belonging to a cradleboard, vegetable fibers that served as matting, and a rope.\\n        The human remains were collected near the town of Indian Springs, located 45 miles north of Las Vegas. Indian Springs is within the western Paiute and Shoshone traditional occupation area. Ted Howard, Cultural Resources Director for the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation, NV, has indicated that the cradle is typical of those used by Great Basin Native Americans.
