The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        \\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item\\n        In 2014, one cultural item was donated to the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum by the children of J. Donald Detenber, from Westborough, MA. Detenber was a collector and dealer in Native American objects, and it is unclear when and where he acquired the object. Detenber was most active in the 1980s and 1990s and purchased from various dealers and auction houses across the country. The sacred object/object of cultural patrimony is a woven cotton sash.\\n        This type of textile was used primarily by the bride in the traditional Hopi wedding ceremony and can be seen in various photographs from the early 20th century. As part of the ceremony, cotton was collected from various members of the community and woven by a specific group of relatives. Another known use of these sashes is the Powamu Festival, centered on the seasonal planting of beans. One aspect of the ceremonies is the imitation of Katchinas (ancestral spirits). In some cases, men would don the sash to dress as female Katchina spirits or women in general. One such female Katchina is Angwusnasomtaka (Crow Mother), who is often represented with this type of sash. Based on the above definitions and a general knowledge of these objects being used in various types of ceremonies, there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the cultural item and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona.\\n        Determinations Made by the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum\\n\\n        Officials of the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum have determined that:\\n        \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the one cultural item described above is a specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the one cultural item described above has ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred object and object of cultural patrimony and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim this cultural item should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Aaron F.
