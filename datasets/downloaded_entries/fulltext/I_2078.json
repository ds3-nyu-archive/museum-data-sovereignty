The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Leech Lake Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Lower Sioux Reservation in Minnesota; Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; Prairie Island Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Prairie Island Reservation, Minnesota; Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians of the Red Lake Reservation, Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Sac and Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota; Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians of North Dakota; Upper Sioux Indian Community of the Upper Sioux Reservation, Minnesota; White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. \\n        In 1905, human remains representing one individual were donated to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology by G.F. Will and H.J. Spinden. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n\\n        Museum records indicate that these remains were collected by Messrs. Will and Spinden from the Mandan Village site (also known as the Burgois or Double Ditch site, 32BL8), Mandan, ND, in 1905 as part of a Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology expedition and were accessioned into the museum that year. \\n        Archeological evidence indicates that the Mandan Village site dates to the Heart River complex (A.D. 1450-1780), which shows cultural continuity with sites occupied by the Mandan tribe in the postcontact period. Combined archeological, historical, and oral tradition evidence indicate that there is a shared group identity between the Heart River complex and the historic Mandan tribe. The Mandan tribe is represented by the present-day Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold, Reservation, North Dakota. \\n        In 1885, human remains representing two individuals were donated to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology by Henry W. Coe. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum records indicate that these remains were collected by Mr. Coe from the Mandan Village site in Mandan, ND, in 1885, and were accessioned into the museum the same year. \\n        Archeological evidence indicates that the Mandan Village site dates to the Heart River complex (A.D. 1450-1780), which shows cultural continuity with sites occupied by the Mandan tribe in the postcontact period. Combined archeological, historical, and oral tradition evidence indicates that there is a shared group identity between the Heart River complex and the historic Mandan tribe. The Mandan tribe is represented by the present-day Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold, Reservation, North Dakota. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above are reasonably believed to be the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Leech Lake Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Lower Sioux Reservation in Minnesota; Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; Prairie Island Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Prairie Island Reservation, Minnesota; Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians of the Red Lake Reservation, Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Sac and Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota; Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians of North Dakota; Upper Sioux Indian Community of the Upper Sioux Reservation, Minnesota; White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.
