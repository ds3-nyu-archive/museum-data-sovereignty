No known individuals were identified. The sixteen associated \\nfunerary objects include faunal remains.\\n    Based on cultural material of the site, including chipped lithics, \\nslate, modified cobbles, a stone lamp fragment, ochre, and worked bone, \\nthis midden site has been determined to be pre-European contact in age. \\nThe cultural material is consistent with objects found within sites \\nknown to be affiliated with Chugach Alaska Corporation, Cook Inlet \\nRegion, Inc., Kenaitze Indian Tribe, Ninichik Village Traditional \\nCouncil, Port Graham Village Council, Nanwalek Village Council, Native \\nVillage of Salamatof, and the Seldovia Village Tribe, and Chugachuk \\nIsland lies within the traditional territories of these Native Alaska \\nVillages and Native Corporations. Consultation with Native Elders of \\nthese Native Alaska Villages indicates there is a traditional \\nassociation with Chugachuk Island and these villages.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nUniversity of Alaska Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical \\nremains of five individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of \\nthe University of Alaska Museum have also determined that, pursuant to \\n25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the sixteen objects listed above are reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \\nLastly, officials of the University of Alaska Museum have determined \\nthat, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared \\ngroup identity which can be reasonably traced between these Native \\nAmerican human remains and associated funerary objects and the Chugach \\nAlaska Corporation, Cook Inlet Region, Inc., Kenaitze Indian Tribe, \\nNinilchik Village Traditional Council, Port Graham Village Council, \\nNanwalek Village Council, Native Village of Salamatof, and the Seldovia \\nVillage Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Chugach Alaska \\nCorporation, Cook Inlet Region, Inc., Kenaitze Indian Tribe, Ninilchik \\nVillage Traditional Council, Port Graham Village Council, Nanwalek \\nVillage Council, Native Village of Salamatof, and the Seldovia Village \\nTribe.
