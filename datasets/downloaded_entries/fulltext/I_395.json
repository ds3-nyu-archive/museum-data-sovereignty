Professor Troost was a founding member of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and state geologist for Tennessee (1831-1839). The mound is situated at the junction of the French Broad and Holston Rivers on private land. At some time prior to October of 1838, the human remains were loaned to Dr. Samuel G. Morton for his study of human crania from around the world, and accessioned into his collections between 1839 and 1840. In 1853, Dr. Morton\\'s collections were formally presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, loaned to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in 1966, and formally gifted to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in 1997 (UPM no. 97-606-992). The human remains consist of a cranium representing a single male, over 50 years old. No known individuals were identified.\\n        Archival records and museum documentation do not designate a specific culture for this individual. Published anthropological information indicates that the Brakebill Mound site is a Dallas Phase archeological site dating from 1300 to 1600 CE.
