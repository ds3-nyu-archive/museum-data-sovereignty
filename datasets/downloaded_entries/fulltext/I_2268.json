Foundation, \\nand the Kenaitze Indian Tribe.\\n    In 1974, human remains representing a minimum of 23 individuals \\nwere recovered at the Cottonwood Creek site (SEL 030) on the north \\nshore of Kachemak Bay, south-central Alaska during archeological \\nexcavations conducted by Alaska Methodist University and the Anchorage \\nCommunity College. No known individuals were identified. The 3,200 \\nassociated funerary objects include bone and shell beads, labrets, two \\nbone knives, two diamond-shaped artificial eyes, a tiny bone inlay, and \\nan edged slate scrap.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects; radiocarbon dating of the \\nsite; and manner of interment unique to the time period, these burials \\nare estimated to date to between 2,000 and 1,500 years ago. Based on \\nthese dates, the Cottonwood Creek site has been identified as a late-\\nstage Kachemak Tradition occupation.\\n    In 1974, human remains representing a minimum of four individuals \\nwere recovered from the Chugachik Island site (SEL 033) on Chugachik \\nIsland during a test excavation conducted by Alaska Methodist \\nUniversity and the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources \\nDivision of Parks, Office of History and Archeology. No known \\nindividuals were identified. No associated funerary objects were \\npresent.\\n    In 1977, human remains representing a minimum of 13 individuals \\nwere\\n\\n[[Page 46718]]\\n\\nrecovered from the Chugachik Island site (SEL 033) during archeological \\nexcavations conducted by the University of Alaska-Anchorage and \\nAnchorage Community College. No known individuals were identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects are present.\\n    In 1980, human remains representing a minimum of one individual \\nwere removed from an eroding midden face at the Chugachik Island site \\n(SEL 033) by a unknown visitor and donated to the Laboratory of \\nAnthropology, University of Alaska, Anchorage. No known individual was \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    In 1981, human remains representing up to 45 individuals were \\nrecovered from the Chugachik Island site (SEL 033) during archeological \\nexcavations conducted by the University of Alaska-Anchorage and \\nAnchorage Community College. No known individuals were identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects are present.\\n    In 1982, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals \\nwere recovered from the Chugachik Island site (SEL 033) and an \\nassociated beach front by Peter Zollars under the supervision of the \\nUniversity of Alaska-Anchorage. No known individuals were identified. \\nNo associated funerary objects are present.\\n    In 1984, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom the Chugachik Island site (SEL 033) by Peter Zollars under the \\nsupervision of the University of Alaska-Anchorage. No known individual \\nwas identified. No associated funerary objects were present.\\n    In 1995, human remains representing a minimum of four individuals \\nwere recovered from the Chugachik Island site (SEL033) by a local \\nresident. No known individuals were identified. The one associated \\nfunerary object is a birdbone tube cut at both ends.\\n    At an unknown date, human remains representing one individual from \\na beach at the Chugachik Island site (SEL033) were recovered by an \\nunknown person and donated to the University of Alaska-Anchorage. No \\nknown individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are \\npresent.\\n    Based on radiocarbon dating, burial practices, intentionally \\nmodified human remains, and material culture, the Chugachik Island site \\nhas been identified as a Kachemak Tradition occupation dating to \\nbetween 2400 to 1500 years ago.\\n    In 1977, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom the Yukon Island Fox Farm site (SEL041) on Yukon Island during \\nexcavations under the direction of William Workman (University of \\nAlaska-Anchorage) and John Lobdell (Anchorage Community College). No \\nknown individual was identified. No associated funerary objects were \\npresent.\\n    In 1978, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom the Yukon Island Fox Farm site (SEL041) during a house pit trench \\nexcavation conducted by Frederica De Laguna and Karen Workman which \\nincluded this disturbed burial in slough deposits. No known individual \\nwas identified. In 1993, three associated funerary objects were \\nrecovered from this burial and consist of a whalebone dagger and two \\nbarbed darts.\\n    In 1985, human remains representing a minimum of one individual \\nwere recovered from the Yukon Island Fox Farm site (SEL041) during \\nexcavations conducted by Peter Zollars. No known individual was \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    In 1986, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals \\nwere recovered from the Yukon Island Fox Farm site (SEL041) during \\nexcavations conducted by Peter Zollars. No known individual was \\nidentified. The one associated funerary object is a hammerstone.\\n    In 1987, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals \\nwere recovered from the Yukon Island Fox Farm site (SEL041) during \\nexcavations conducted by William Workman (University of Alaska-\\nAnchorage) and Peter Zollars. No known individuals were identified. The \\nten associated funerary objects include a porpoise skull and other non-\\nhuman bones.\\n    In 1978, human remains representing a minimum of one individual \\nwere recovered from preserved buried beach deposits at the Great Midden \\nsite (SEL001) on Yukon Island during excavations conducted by John \\nLobdell of Anchorage Community College and Frederica De Laguna. No \\nknown individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are \\npresent.\\n    Based on radiocarbon dating and material culture, the Yukon Island \\nFox Farm site and the Great Midden site have been identified as \\nKachemak Tradition occupation dating to 1500--3000 years ago.\\n    In 1984, human remains representing a minimum of one individual \\nwere collected from a burial eroding down a steep slope at the front of \\nthe North Bluff site on Yukon Island by William Workman of the \\nUniversity of Alaska-Anchorage. No known individuals were identified. \\nNo associated funerary objects are present.\\n    This site has not been investigated, however, a late Kachemak \\nTradition provenance seems likely based on the considerable depth of \\nthe exposed cultural deposits.\\n    In 1978, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals \\nwere collected from an eroding midden site on Neptune Bay, Kachemak Bay \\nby University of Alaska-Anchorage and Anchorage Community College \\narcheologists. No known individuals were identified. No associated \\nfunerary objects are present.\\n    This site on Neptune Bay has not been investigated, however, a late \\nKachemak Tradition provenance seems likely based on the considerable \\ndepth of the exposed cultural deposits.\\n    Although the people of the Kachemak Tradition withdrew from \\nKachemak Bay no later than around 1,000 years ago, they were closely \\nrelated in biology and culture to contemporary Kachemak Tradition \\npeople in the Kodiak Archipelago, with whom it is probable that they \\namalgamated. The Kodiak version of the Kachemak Tradition has been \\nclearly documented by detailed archeological study of cultural material \\nfrom a number of archeological sites and human biological study of \\nseveral hundred human remains as the primary cultural and biological \\nancestor of the contemporary Alutiiq people of the Kodiak Archipelago \\nand adjacent areas. The Kachemak Bay manifestation of the Kachemak \\nTradition should thus be viewed as a regional expression of ancestral \\nAlutiiq or Pacific Eskimo culture, a complex long-enduring (at least \\n3,800 years) regional mosaic of cultural patterns with living \\ndescendents in the Kodiak archipelago, Prince William Sound, and \\nelsewhere in south central Alaska.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nUniversity of Alaska-Anchorage have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical \\nremains of 108 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of \\nthe University of Alaska-Anchorage have also determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the approximately 3,215 objects listed above are \\nreasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human \\nremains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or \\nceremony. Lastly, officials of the University of Alaska-Anchorage have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nNative American human remains and associated funerary objects and the \\nChugach Alaska Corporation, the Native Village of Port Graham, the \\nNative Village of Nanwalek\\n\\n[[Page 46719]]\\n\\n(aka English Bay), and the Seldovia Village Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Chugach Alaska \\nCorporation, the Chugach Heritage Foundation, the Cook Inlet Region, \\nInc. Foundation, the Kenaitze Indian Tribe, the Native Village of Port \\nGraham, the Native Village of Nanwalek (aka English Bay), and the \\nSeldovia Village Tribe. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Professor William \\nWorkman, Department of Anthropology, University of Alaska-Anchorage, \\n3211 Providence Drive, Anchorage, AK 99508; telephone: (907) 789-6842, \\nbefore September 27, 1999. Repatriation of the human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects to the Chugach Alaska Corporation on behalf \\nof the Native Village of Port Graham, the Native Village of Nanwalek \\n(aka English Bay), and the Seldovia Village Tribe may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: August 10, 1999.\\nRichard Waldbauer,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nArcheology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 99-22167 Filed 8-25-99; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
