The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In 1903, one cultural item was removed from the Pueblo of Laguna in Cibola, Valencia, Bernalillo and Sandoval counties, NM. One other cultural item is believed to have been removed from the same community at the same time. These two items were collected by Stewart Culin, the first curator that collected American Indian items for the Brooklyn Museum. The Denver Art Museum subsequently acquired the two items from the Brooklyn Museum through an exchange in 1948. The items are two Katsina Friends and meet the definition of both objects of cultural patrimony and sacred objects.\\n        The review of available documentation, in addition to physical inspections by multiple Pueblo of Laguna delegations, has resulted in confirmation from Pueblo of Laguna religious leaders that the two Katsina Friends are of Pueblo of Laguna origin. The Pueblo of Laguna asserts that a relationship of shared group identity exists between the Pueblo of Laguna in 1903, and the present-day Pueblo of Laguna. These Katsina Friends were created within the Pueblo of Laguna religious system with construction techniques still used today. In addition to the positive identification by Laguna religious leaders that the two Katsina Friends are of Laguna Pueblo origin, cultural affiliation with the Pueblo of Laguna is evident by a variety of diagnostic features. The catalog cards also associate these two items with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaguna.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        Determinations Made by the Denver Art Museum\\n        Officials of the Denver Art Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the two cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the two cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony and the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to John P.
