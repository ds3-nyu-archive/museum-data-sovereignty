McDonald of Carbondale, KS. Information provided by the \\ndonor states the items were removed ``from graves approximately three \\nmiles southwest of Mayetta, Kans.\\'\\' The cultural items most likely date \\nfrom the 1850s through the 1860s. The land that is three miles \\nsouthwest of Mayetta, KS is within the Prairie Band Potawatomi \\nReservation which has been exclusively occupied by the Potawatomi since \\n1848.\\n    Officials of the Kansas State Historical Society have determined \\nthat, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), these fourteen cultural items \\nare reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual \\nhuman remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite \\nor ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to \\nhave been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American \\nindividual. Officials of the Kansas State Historical Society have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these items and the Citizen Band of Potawatomi and the Prairie \\nBand of Potawatomi Indians.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Citizen Band of \\nPotawatomi and the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians. Representatives \\nof any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally \\naffiliated with these objects should contact Randy Thies, Archeologist, \\nKansas State Historical Society, 6425 SW Sixth, Topeka, KS 66606-1099; \\ntelephone (913) 272-8681 ext. 267 before August 27, 1997. Repatriation \\nof these objects to the Citizen Band of Potawatomi and the Prairie Band \\nof Potawatomi Indians may begin after that date if no additional \\nclaimants come forward.\\nDated: July 21, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
