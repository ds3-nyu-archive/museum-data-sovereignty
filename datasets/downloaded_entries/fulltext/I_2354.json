No known \\nindividual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    Based on the location of the remains and the state of preservation, \\nthis individual has been determined to be Native American. In 1985, the \\nPort Huron Museum deaccessioned all Native American human remains in \\nits collections and turned them over to a representative of the Walpole \\nIsland First Nation. Although included in the 1985 deaccessioning, the \\nhuman remains noted above were accidently overlooked and discovered in \\nthe Museum\\'s collections in 1998.\\n    The human remains listed above constitute newly-found items from a \\npreviously repatriated collection. Because the previous repatriated \\ncollection was returned prior to the enactment of NAGPRA, this notice \\nis being published to document the return of human remains as part of \\nan action on a repatriation request pending on the date of NAGPRA\\'s \\nenactment. As the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan and the \\nWalpole Island First Nation communities are culturally related and \\nworking in cooperation regarding repatriation activities, this pending \\nrepatriation request will now involve the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe \\nof Michigan.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Port \\nHuron Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the \\nhuman remains listed above represent the physical remains of one \\nindividual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Port Huron \\nMuseum have not determined the cultural affiliation of these Native \\nAmerican human remains because, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3009 (2), these \\nhuman remains are part of an action on a repatriation request pending \\non the date of enactment of NAPGRA and will therefore be repatriated to \\nthe Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Saginaw Chippewa \\nIndian Tribe of Michigan and Walpole Island First Nation of Canada. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes it may have an \\ninterest in these human remains should contact Stephen R. Williams, \\nDirector, Port Huron Museum, 1115 Sixth Street, Port Huron, MI 48060; \\ntelephone: (810) 982-0891.\\nDated: May 21, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
