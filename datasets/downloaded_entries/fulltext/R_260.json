Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution. The Elden Pueblo (site NA 142) is on the Coconino National Forest. These four objects have been curated at the Natural History Museum of Utah since 1932, when the Smithsonian Institution transferred the objects to the museum. The four unassociated funerary objects are three ceramic bowls and one ceramic jar.\\n        Based on archaeological evidence and material culture, Elden Pueblo (site NA 142) has been identified as a Northern Sinagua site, comprised of a pueblo, pithouses, and outlier pueblos, which were occupied in the second half of the 13th and the first quarter of the 14th centuries A.D. The records at the Natural History Museum of Utah and the Smithsonian Institution indicate that these four cultural items were removed from a burial context and that the human remains were either left in the ground or are not locatable at the present time. Continuities among the ethnographic materials in the Flagstaff area of north central Arizona indicate that the Northern Sinagua sites in that area are affiliated with the Hopi Tribe, Arizona.
