The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Between the 1950s and 2002, a cultural item was removed from an unspecified location in the Columbia River area in Washington. The cultural item was collected by Ms. Rosemary Horwood through purchase and donated to the Burke Museum in 2004 (Burke Accn. #2004-72). No human remains are present. The one unassociated funerary object is a necklace of copper beads.\\n        Exact provenience is unknown; however, the cultural item is consistent with cultural items typically found in the context with burials in eastern Washington.\\n        In 1959-1960, 15 cultural items were removed from the north bank of the Snake River, approximately five to six miles down river from the mouth of the Palouse River in Franklin County, WA, by Dr. Harold Bergen and Mrs. Marjory Bergen. The Bergens designated this site #14 or the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPipe Site.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cultural items were donated to the Burke Museum in 1989 (Burke Accn. #1989-57). The 15 unassociated funerary objects are 1 groundstone tool, 1 core, 1 stone pendant, 1 hammer stone, 1 modified stone, 1 stone paint pot, 1 pipe, 4 points, 3 scrapers, and 1 bag containing over 200 seeds.\\n\\n        The burial pattern and unassociated funerary objects are consistent with Native American Plateau customs. The 1963 Indian Claims Commission decision indicates that this area is within the Palouse aboriginal territory. Early and late ethnographic documentation indicates that the present-day location of the Snake River in Franklin County, WA is within an overlapping aboriginal territory of the Cayuse, Palouse, Yakama, and Walla Walla (Daugherty 1973, Hale 1841, Mooney 1896, Ray 1936, Spier 1936, Sprague 1998, Stern 1998) whose descendants are members of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group. Information provided by the tribes listed above indicates that the aboriginal ancestors occupying this area were highly mobile and traveled the landscape for gathering resources as well as trade, and are all part of the more broadly defined Plateau cultural community.\\n        Between the 1890s and early 1900s, 18 cultural items were removed from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlateau area\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Dr. Robert E. Stewart and purchased by the Burke Museum in 1905 (Burke Accn. #40). The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlateau area\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a broadly defined cultural area. No human remains are present. The 18 unassociated funerary objects are 4 metal pendants, 7 metal bells, 1 bunch of thimbles and beads strung together, 5 metal bracelets, and 1 brass ornament.\\n        Between 1889 and 1902, 118 cultural items were removed from Celilo Island, Klickitat County, WA, by Dr. Stewart and purchased by the Burke Museum in 1905 (Burke Accn. #40). No human remains are present. The 118 unassociated funerary objects are 3 atlatl weights, 2 axe heads, 1 groundstone ball, 8 stone beads, 6 stone carvings, 1 metal club, 6 grooved abraders, 19 groundstone tools, 2 knives, 1 maul, 1 metal spear point, 1 mortars, 1 net weight, 17 paint dishes or mortars, 19 stone pendants, 3 pestles, 6 pipes, 2 pistol barrels, 2 points, 1 stone sculpture, 1 metal spear, 2 metal spikes,12 stone war club heads, and 1 metal chisel.\\n        Between 1890 and 1895, four cultural items were removed near Goldendale in Klickitat County, WA, by Dr. Stewart and donated to the Burke Museum in 1905 (Burke Accn. #40). No human remains are present. The four unassociated funerary objects are one stone sculpture, one metal axe head, one pistol barrel, and one gaming piece.\\n        Between 1896 and 1902, eight cultural items were removed from Memaloose Island, Klickitat County, WA. The objects were removed from a grave and purchased by Dr. Stewart. The Burke Museum purchased the unassociated funerary objects from Dr. Stewart in 1905 (Burke Accn. #40). No human remains are present. The eight unassociated funerary objects are two metal axe heads, one knife, one metal point, one metal tool, one metal spear, one metal spike, and one metal war club.\\n        Between 1896 and 1902, 60 cultural items were removed from an unspecified location in the Chamberlain Flats area in Klickitat County, WA, by Dr. Stewart and purchased by the Burke Museum in 1905 (Burke Accn. #40). No human remains are present. The 60 unassociated funerary objects are 1 metal axe head, 4 chipped stone tools, 1 carved stone effigy figure, 9 mauls, 2 bone tools with stone fragment, 1 antler tool with stone fragment, 4 groundstone tools, 1 moccasin last, 10 mortars, 4 paint dishes/mortars, 9 pestles, 4 pipes, 1 pistol barrel, 1 metal point, 1 stone sculpture, 6 stone sinkers, and 1 metal spear.\\n        Museum documentation indicates that Dr. Stewart collected from Native American graves at the five sites described above. Exact provenience of each cultural item is unknown, however, Dr. Stewart primarily collected in Klickitat County, WA. The cultural items have been determined to be unassociated funerary objects based on the fact that these sites were described by Dr. Stewart as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburial ground.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cultural items are also consistent with funerary objects typically found in the context with burials in eastern Washington.\\n        In 1925, one cultural item was removed from a cremation pit by an unknown individual on an island in the Columbia River in Klickitat or Skamania County, WA. The cultural item is a metal lid, which was donated by Mrs. Irene A. Walker to the Burke Museum in 1963 (Burke Accn. #1963-139). A note found with the lid indicates that the island was located near the Bridge of Gods. No human remains are present.\\n        Between 1950 and 1960, 57 cultural items were removed from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKlickitat Cremation Pit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d east of Little and Big Klickitat Rivers in Klickitat County, WA, by Dr. Bergen. Dr. Bergen designated the location as Site #22 and donated the cultural items to the Burke Museum in 1989 (Burke Accn. #1989-57). No human remains are present.

The objects are consistent with cultural items typically found in the context with burials in eastern Washington. Early and late published ethnographic documentation indicates that this was the aboriginal territory of the Western Columbia River Sahaptins, Wasco, Wishram, Yakima, Walla Walla, Umatilla, Tenino, and Skin (Daugherty 1973, Hale 1841, Hunn and French 1998, Stern 1998, French and French 1998, Mooney 1896, Murdock 1938, Ray 1936 and 1974, Spier 1936) whose descendants are members of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; and Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon. Information provided by the representatives the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group, during consultation indicates the aboriginal ancestors occupying the area where all the above mentioned sites are located were highly mobile and traveled the landscape for gathering resources as well as trade, and are all part of the more broadly defined Plateau cultural community.\\n        In 1955, 10 cultural items were removed from an island in the Snake River in Walla Walla County, WA, by Mrs. Stanley Randolph and donated to the Burke Museum in 1955 (Burke Accn. #4010). No human remains are present. The 10 unassociated funerary objects are 1 lot of trade beads, 2 pieces of hammered copper ornaments, 6 copper tube beads, and 1 piece of iron.\\n        In 1958, 97 cultural items were removed from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPalouse Site,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also designated as Site #9, on the east side of the Palouse River where it empties into the Snake River in Whitman County, WA. The cultural items were donated to the Burke Museum in 1989 (Burke Accn. #1989-57). The 97 unassociated funerary objects are 53 olivella shell beads, 8 dentalium shell beads, 6 shell beads, 2 teeth, 11 copper beads, 2 mauls, 1 lot of organic matter, 4 copper pendants, 2 copper pendant fragments, 2 pestles, 4 points, and 2 scrapers.\\n        The burial pattern and cultural items are consistent with Native American plateau customs. The 1963 Indian Claims Commission decision indicates that this area was within the Palouse aboriginal territory. Early and late ethnographic documentation indicates that the present-day location of the Snake River is located within an overlapping aboriginal territory of the Cayuse, Palouse, Yakama, and Walla Walla (Daugherty 1973, Hale 1841, Mooney 1896, Ray 1936, Spier 1936, Sprague 1998, Stern 1998,) whose descendants are members of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group.\\n        Between 1955 and 1957, 21 cultural items were removed from the B. Stewart Site in Wasco County, OR, by a University of Washington Field Party led by Mr. Robert B. Butler. The cultural items were received by the Burke Museum in 1957 and accessioned in 1966 (Burke Accn. #1966-100). Human remains were not removed from the site. The 21 unassociated funerary objects are 1 adze blade, 2 bone clubs, 3 copper fragments, 1 ground stone tool, 2 mortars, 6 pipes, 2 point fragments, 1 point, and 3 pieces of worked bone.\\n        The site included a series of cremations overlooking Celilo Falls. Museum documentation indicates that the cultural items were removed from graves. The objects are consistent with cultural items typically found along the Columbia River in Eastern Washington and Oregon.\\n        The 1963 Indian Claims Commission decision indicates that this area was within the aboriginal territory of the Warm Springs. Information provided by the representatives the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group, during consultation indicates the aboriginal ancestors occupying the area where all the above mentioned sites are located were highly mobile and traveled the landscape for gathering resources as well as trade, and are all part of the more broadly defined Plateau cultural community.\\n\\n        The descendants of these Plateau communities of Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon are now widely dispersed and are members of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group.\\n        Officials of the Burke Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B), the 10,857 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual. Officials of the Burke Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; and Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho. Furthermore, officials of the Burke Museum have determined that there is a cultural relationship between the unassociated funerary objects and the Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary objects should contact Dr. Peter Lape, Burke Museum, University of Washington, Box 353010, Seattle, WA 98195-3010, telephone (206) 685-2282, before June 25, 2007. Repatriation of the unassociated funerary objects to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington, for themselves and on behalf of the Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and Wanapum Band, non-federally recognized Indian group, are claiming jointly all cultural items from the Columbia River area in eastern Washington and Oregon.\\n        The Burke Museum is responsible for notifying the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; and Wanapum Band, a non-federally recognized Indian group that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: May 14, 2007\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
