In 1976, the Oregon State University\\'s Department of Anthropology acquired the Neumann Collection from Georg Neumann\\'s son. These individuals are labeled with the identification of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Dr. Neumann and a doctoral student, Louise Robbins, collected human remains from several archeological sites during their research projects with a focus on archeological mound sites, skeletal characteristics of Native American races, and general human physical variation and skeletal morphology. The culmination of this research is published as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArchaeology and Race in the American Indian,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the 1952 Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, Vol. 8, and in Louise Robbins\\' doctoral dissertation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Identification of the Prehistoric Shawnee Indians: The Description of the Populations of the Fort Ancient Aspect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Indiana University, 1968). Collection records accompanying the human remains document Dr. Neumann\\'s work with survey archeologists in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. The records state that Dr. Neumann was collecting human remains in Christian County, western Kentucky, and in the Cumberland River Basin. Neumann\\'s site documents include records for burial sites along Dulins Creek (Ch 19) in Kentucky.\\n\\n        Between 1930 and 1971, human remains representing, at minimum, eight individuals were removed from an unknown site in Casey County, KY, by Dr. Neumann. In 1976, the Oregon State University Department of Anthropology acquired the Neumann Collection from Georg Neumann\\'s son. These individuals are labeled with the identification of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCS.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Representatives of the Kentucky Archaeological Survey confirm that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the Smithsonian county abbreviation for Casey County. No known individuals were identified.

In addition to the published research described above, the records also include notes for a talk on Native American archeological periods in Kentucky. The notes list specific culture periods found in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWestern Kentucky, headwaters of the Green River and Eastern Mountains area\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Robbins 1971), one of which is the Fort Ancient culture period. The headwaters of the Green River flow through Casey County, KY.\\n        Between 1930 and 1971, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in Scott County, KY, by Dr. Neumann.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Representatives of the Kentucky Archaeological Survey confirm that mound sites are common along rivers in Kentucky, including Fort Ancient culture period mounds that Neumann was known to excavate. Louise Robbins\\' doctoral dissertation (Robbins 1968) includes a map of the distribution of the Madisonville Focus of the Fort Ancient archeological cultural assemblage, and this area includes Scott County, KY. Robbins\\' dissertation further explains the relationship between Neumann and the Fort Ancient assemblage excavations, placing Neumann at the excavations with the primary responsibility for the human remains data.\\n        It is reasonably believed the individuals in this notice are all from the Fort Ancient culture period (circa 1100 to 1650 A.D.).
