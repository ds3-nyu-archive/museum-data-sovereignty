The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item(s)\\n        In 1964, seven cultural items were removed from Ojibwe communities in unknown counties, MN. In the 1950s, Karen Petersen and her husband Sydney Petersen spent their summers visiting Ojibwe communities, buying crafts from tribal members. These items belonged to John Mink, a fourth-degree Midewiwin priest at the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota. Soon after Mink\\'s death in 1962 or 1963, museum records affirm the items were dug up to be offered for sale. Petersen sold the cache to Mary and Francis Crane on February 2, 1976, with the exception of one scroll (A943.1), which was donated to the Denver Museum of Natural History (now the Denver Museum of Nature & Science or DMNS) directly in November 1976. The Cranes in turn donated the other six unassociated funerary objects to the DMNS in December 1976. The seven unassociated funerary objects are 2 birch bark scrolls (A943.1 and AC.11525), 2 ceremonial invitation sets (AC.11528 and AC.11529), 2 medicine bags (AC.11535B and AC.11535J), and 1 vessel containing ceremonial stain (AC.11530).\\n        Between 1950 and 1964, six cultural items were removed from Ojibwe communities in unknown counties, MN. Karen Petersen purchased four cultural items (AC.11533, AC.11536A, AC.11536B, and AC.11538) from Ole Sam who had inherited these objects in 1960 from the estate of his father, Mike Sam, a Midewiwin priest. Petersen sold the cultural items to Mary and Francis Crane on February 5, 1976, who donated them to THE DMNS in December 1976. Petersen purchased one cultural item (ac.11526) from Annie Sam, a rare fourth-degree Midewiwin female priest. On February 2, 1976, the Cranes purchased the cultural item and donated it to the DMNS in December 1976. Petersen purchased one cultural item (AC.115351) from Maggie Skinaway in 1961. On February 19, 1976, Petersen sold the cultural item to the Cranes who donated it to the DMNS in December 1976. The six sacred objects are 1 ceremonial post (AC.11533), 1 large cowrie shell (AC.11536A), 1 collection of 19 shells (AC.11536B), 1 ceremonial drumstick (AC.115381), 1 birch bark scroll (AC.11526), and 1 medicine bag (AC.11535I).\\n        Museum accession, catalogue, and documentary records, as well as consultation with representatives of the Mille Lacs Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota, indicate that the 13 cultural objects are Ojibwe and are from the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, Minnesota. The 13 cultural items, A943.1, AC.11525, AC.11528, AC.11529, AC.11530, AC.11535B, AC.11535J, AC.11533, AC.11536A, AC.11536B, AC 11538, AC.11526, and AC.11535I, relate to the Grand Medicine Society or Midewiwin, a ritual society.\\n        Determinations Made by the Denver Museum of Nature & Science\\n        Officials of the Denver Museum of Nature & Science have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 7 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the 6 cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Mille Lacs Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and the Mille Lacs Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Chip Colwell, Senior Curator of Anthropology and NAGPRA Officer, Denver Museum of Nature & Science, 2001 Colorado Boulevard., Denver, CO 80205, telephone (303) 370-6378, email Chip.Colwell@dmns.org, by February 13, 2017.
