In January of 2008, Dr. Lourdes DeLeon, a physical anthropologist at Central Washington University, prepared a description of a number of sets of human remains known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFormer Teaching Collection at Washington State University.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d During the course of this work she identified the remains of two individuals who, based on the color of the bone, were believed to have been buried in a shell midden. Examination of photographs taken during the burial excavations done at the Minard site indicated that these were human remains formerly determined to be missing from the Minard collection.\\n        In the Federal Register notice of May 17, 2007, paragraph 4 is corrected by substituting the following paragraphs:\\n        In 1969 and 1970, human remains representing a minimum of 11 individuals were removed from the Minard site (45-GH-15) in Grays Harbor County, WA, by Richard Daugherty, an employee, and Tom E. Roll, a graduate student, of Washington State University. The excavations were conducted under research funds allocated by the Washington State Legislature. No known individuals were identified.
