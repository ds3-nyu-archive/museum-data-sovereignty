The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from multiple sites in Crawford County, WI.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Wisconsin Historical Society professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation of Wisconsin; Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin; and Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1937, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Rock Shelter #4 (47-CR-0191) in Crawford County, WI. The site was first documented in 1937, by Leland Cooper who was associated with the Wisconsin Historical Society at the time. A Wisconsin Historical Society card catalog lists 97 artifacts recovered as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgeneral sample from 4-10 inches deep in floor of rockshelter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were collected by Cooper in 1937 and accessioned by the Wisconsin Historical Society in 1978. Later analysis of the collection revealed human remains that represent one individual of indeterminate age and sex. There is no evidence to suggest the artifacts collected and accessioned at the same time are funerary objects associated with the human remains. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1990, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Copper Creek Mound Group (47-CR-0484) in Crawford County, WI. A local informant contacted the Wisconsin Burial Site Preservation Office (BSPO) to report that the site had recently been looted, and representatives of the BPSO visited the site. They conducted a pedestrian survey of the mounds and collected a small group of human remains that were visible on the surface. The few human remains collected are very fragmentary and represent one individual of indeterminate age and sex. No associated funerary objects were found. No known individuals were identified.\\n        In 1993, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Highway 35 (47-CR-0731) in Crawford County, WI. A cranium was found resting next to a cement retaining wall near the property of Thomas and Alleine La Chine near Prairie du Chien. The La Chines contacted the Crawford County Sheriff\\'s Department upon their discovery, and the police subsequently contacted the Wisconsin Burial Sites Preservation Office (BSPO). A representative from the BPSO investigated the site but did not locate any other human remains or artifacts. The human remains were transferred from the Crawford County Sheriff\\'s Department to the Wisconsin Historical Society. The cranium was later determined to be from an adult female with attributes of mixed European-American and Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1976, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from McDonald Graves (47-CR-0166) in Crawford County, WI. The human remains were discovered during a sewer construction project in an alley located in the city of Prairie du Chien. Homeowners initially contacted the Prairie du Chien Police Department, who immediately contacted the Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS). Representatives from the WHS visited the site within days and conducted an excavation in conjunction with the Prairie du Chien Police of what appeared to be profiles of two coffins. The Prairie du Chien Police Department originally took custody of the human remains and artifacts, but transferred them to the WHS in 1976. Skeletal analysis later determined the human remains represent an adult male and an adult female, both of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is a group of 20 coffin nails and fragments of wood.\\n        In 1960, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Miller Site (47-CR-0001) in Crawford County, WI. The Miller Site was investigated in 1960 and 1961 by the Wisconsin Historical Society\\'s Highway Archaeology Program under a cooperative agreement with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. During the 1960 excavations, the remains of a single adult male were excavated from a burial pit located in the southern portion of the investigated area. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Waterfront Site (47-CR-0436) in Crawford County, WI. Local resident J.P. Albee discovered human remains representing two probable male individuals on St. Feriole Island along the East Channel of the Mississippi River in the city of Prairie du Chien. Mr. Albee donated the human remains to the Wisconsin Historical Society in 1912. No known individuals were identified.
