No known individuals were identified. The 483 associated funerary objects are 170 lots of unmodified shell, 1 perforated shell, 124 lots of unmodified bone, 8 modified bone objects, 73 lots of fire modified rock, 13 stone tools, 1 modified wood object, 3 lots of ochre, 42 lots of charcoal, 30 lots of bulk material, 16 historic objects, and 2 lots of botanical material.\\n        Between 2002 and 2006, State Parks contracted Cascadia Archaeology to survey and subsequently perform excavation and data recovery of site 45-IS-2 for the purposes of upgrading sewer and utility lines. Historically the site is a 1930s-1980s fishing and vacation resort with cabins for visitors and housing for owners and management. During excavation and data recovery it was determined the site\\'s prehistoric use was as a seasonal Native American fishing site. During the survey and excavation phases of the project four burials were discovered.
