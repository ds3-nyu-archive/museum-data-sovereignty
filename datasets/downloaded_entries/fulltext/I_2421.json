No known individual was \\nidentified. The four associated funerary objects include a historic \\npearl four-hole button, two fish bones, and a bag of soil matrix of the \\nburial.\\n    In 1987, human remains representing four individuals were recovered \\nby U.S. Army Corps archeological staff after being unearthed by \\nneighborhood children digging in the substrate beneath Quarters #14 in \\nthe family housing area of Fort Kamehameha.

Lastly, officials of the U.S. Army have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects and Hui Malama I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei, the Oahu Burial \\nCouncil, and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of Hui Malama I Na Kupuna \\'O \\nHawai\\'i Nei, the Oahu Burial Council, and the Office of Hawaiian \\nAffairs.
