The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Allegan County, MI.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Western Michigan University, Department of Anthropology, professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; and Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. The Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan and Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan have sent the Western Michigan University, Department of Anthropology, letters of support and do not object to disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects described in this notice to the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1968, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Allegan Dam Site, in Valley Township, Allegan County, MI, during an excavation by a Western Michigan University archeological field school under the direction of Dr. Elizabeth B. Garland. The burial consisted of a single individual placed in a semi-flexed position in a deep pit. The human remains were in a poor state of preservation. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In April 1978, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the Harrington III Site, in Saugatuck Township, Allegan County, MI. The burial was excavated by Dr. Richard Flanders, an archeologist formerly at Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI. This individual was placed in a shallow pit in a semi-flexed position. After recovery, the Harrington III burial was sent to Western Michigan University for curation and further study by Dr. Robert Sundick. The human remains represent a male, between 45 and 60 years of age. No known individual was identified. The two associated funerary objects are turtle shells.\\n        Based on skeletal and dental morphology, as well as cultural materials associated with the Harrington II Site (including two ceramic pots that are not part of the museum collection), the site dates to circa A.D. 1000, during the Late Woodland period.\\n        In 1968, human remains representing a minimum of 36 individuals were removed from the Brainerd Ossuary, in Valley Township, Allegan County, MI, during an excavation by Dr. Elizabeth B. Garland through the university\\'s archeological field school. The burials were encountered in a large ossuary pit that measured 11 x 15 feet and extended 5 feet below the ground surface. The skeletal remains were heavily disturbed due to plowing and the effects of previous intrusive pits, which were likely dug by amateurs. After recovery, the remains were transferred to Western Michigan University for further study and curation. No known individuals were identified.
