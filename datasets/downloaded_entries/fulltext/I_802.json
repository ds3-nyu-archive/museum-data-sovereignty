The human remains were removed from Maricopa County, AZ.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Indiana University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Cocopah Tribe of Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, California and Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona; Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai Reservation, Arizona); and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        During the 1940s-1960s, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site along the Verde River near Horseshoe Dam in Maricopa County, AZ, by an unknown collector. The remains were sold by the collector\\'s widow to a private purchaser in 2013. The Indiana University NAGPRA Office was contacted regarding these remains, which were donated to the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology in November 2013. The collection has been identified as the partial remains of a single child, aged 4-5 years. The human remains consist of a skull and mandible. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Notes included with the collection indicated that the remains were discovered along the Verde River just below Horseshoe Dam, dating to 1200-1400 A.D. and possibly being from the Salado culture. This time period also falls within the Hohokam culture in the Southwest, which dates from 300 to 1450 A.D. Archeological evidence and oral traditions have demonstrated a strong relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Salado and Hohokam cultures and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona. These four Indian tribes are one cultural group known as the O\\'odham. In 1990, the four O\\'odham Indian tribes issued a joint statement claiming cultural affiliation to the Salado and Hohokam archeological cultures, as well as to all others present in their aboriginal claims area in what is known today as Arizona and Mexico.\\n        A relationship of shared group identity can also reasonably be traced between Hohokam culture and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. Based on O\\'odham oral tradition, some of the people occupying the Hohokam area migrated north and joined the Zuni and Hopi. Pursuant to the Hopi Tribal Council Resolution H-70-94, the Hopi claim cultural affiliation with earlier cultural groups in Arizona including the Hohokam. In 2006, official representatives of the Hopi Tribe restated Hopi\\'s shared group identity with Hohokam culture based on oral tradition, traditional geography, archaeological evidence, and on-going cultural traditions. In 1995, the Zuni Tribe issued a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStatement of Cultural Affiliation with Prehistoric and Historic Cultures,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which a relationship of shared group identity with Hohokam culture based on oral traditions and archaeological evidence.
