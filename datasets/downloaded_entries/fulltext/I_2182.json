The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by American Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon and the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. \\n        In 1891, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were collected by an unknown person, possibly D. Ream, M.D., from Linkville (Klamath Falls) (?), Klamath County (?), OR (?). The human remains were acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in 1896 as a purchase from the Giffort brothers. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        This individual has been identified as Native American based on museum documentation. The documentation also indicates that these human remains are Modoc, but does not indicate the age of the remains. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the American Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the American Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon and the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon and the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Martha Graham, Director of Cultural Resources, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, New York, NY 10024-5192, telephone (212) 769-5846, before October 26, 2000. Repatriation of the human remains to the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon and the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: September 19, 2000. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 00-24651 Filed 9-25-00; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY ", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.
