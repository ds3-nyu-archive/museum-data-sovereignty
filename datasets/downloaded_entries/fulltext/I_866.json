The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Grays Harbor County, WA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects was made by the Burke Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation and the Quinault Indian Nation (previously listed as the Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, Washington).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        In 1947, human remains representing, at minimum, four individuals were removed from Grays Harbor County, WA. The human remains and associated funerary objects were collected on an expedition led by Richard Daugherty, as a part of a survey of Grays Harbor County. Three of these individuals are possibly from a site designated by Daugherty as UW Site 15, which was on the Minard Ranch (45-GH-15). This site corresponds with the Native American town of Oyhut. The provenience of the fourth individual collected by Daugherty during his survey of Grays Harbor County is unknown. The human remains and funerary objects were donated to the Burke Museum in 1947 (Burke Accn. #3583). Additional human remains and associated funerary objects from this site were previously published in Notices of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register by Washington State University (May 17, 2007 and corrected August 21, 2008) and Central Washington University (March 16, 2012). No known individuals were identified. The seven associated funerary objects are one net weight, one net weight fragment, three flakes, and two unmodified mammal bone fragments.\\n        In 1960, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from south of Ocean City in Grays Harbor County, WA. Michael Mattbey donated the remains to the Burke Museum in 1962 (Burke Accn. #1963-75). No known individuals were identified. No funerary objects are present.\\n        Osteological and anthropological evidence indicates that the human remains are Native American. The Minard Ranch Site (45-GH-15) is located at or near the traditional Copalis village of Oyhut. The Copalis are a subgroup of the Lower Chehalis of Southwestern Coast Salish culture area. The Copalis speak the Quinault language, while other Lower Chehalis groups speak Lower Chehalis. The traditional territory of the Copalis encompasses the area surrounding the Copalis River and stretching southward to North Bay  (Hajda 1990; Spier 1936). Archeological evidence at the site suggests the site was occupied from approximately 1,000 years before the present until the early 19th century. The Chehalis Reservation was created in 1864 for the Upper Chehalis, Cowlitz, and coastal groups south of Quinault, including the Lower Chehalis. Many Lower Chehalis chose not to be removed from their aboriginal land. Individuals of Lower Chehalis descent are also members of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation (previously listed as the Shoalwater Bay Tribe of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation, Washington) and the Quinault Indian Nation (previously listed as the Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, Washington). Today, the Lower Chehalis are represented by the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.\\n        Determinations Made by the Burke Museum\\n        Officials of the Burke Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Based on anthropological and biological evidence, the human remains are Native American.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of five individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the seven objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Peter Lape, Burke Museum, University of Washington, Box 353010, Seattle, WA 98195, telephone (206) 685-3849, email plape@uw.edu, by February 18, 2014.
