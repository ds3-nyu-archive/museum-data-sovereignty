The human remains were found by hikers and were recovered by the Navajo Department of Public Safety (which is analogous to the current Navajo Police Department), on an unknown date. On October 17, 1989, the human remains were transferred to the PCOME, which were then analyzed by Dr. Walter H. Birkby, a forensic anthropologist at the PCOME. The human remains were designated Forensic Anthropology case FA#89-038, which also indicates that the medical examiners at the PCOME had no involvement in this particular case. According to Dr. Birkby, the human remains were of an adult female of Native American ancestry and likely historic or prehistoric. The human remains have since resided within the PCOME as an unidentified case, and were rediscovered by Dr. Bruce Anderson, the current forensic anthropologist at the PCOME, in 2012. In 2012, an inventory was made but no analysis was done.
