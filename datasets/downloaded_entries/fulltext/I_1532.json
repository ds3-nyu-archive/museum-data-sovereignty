The Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma, and Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska traditionally occupied areas that have been demonstrated to include sites in Illinois. The tribes at one time constituted a single tribe with shared cultural affiliation. Specific published works cite the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma, and Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, as having villages in Illinois that included mound building cultural practices. Based on the preponderance of the evidence, including the primary body of Dr. Neumann\\'s work in Illinois, and collection records, officials of the Oregon State University Department of Anthropology reasonably believe that the human remains are affiliated with the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma, and Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.\\n        Officials of the Oregon State University Department of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Oregon State University Department of Anthropology have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma, and Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. David McMurray, Oregon State University Department of Anthropology, 238 Waldo Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331, telephone (541) 737-4515, before June 23, 2008.
