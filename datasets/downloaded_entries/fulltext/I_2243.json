Kimbrough, a contracted civil engineer \\nwith the Baker Engineering Company, Rochester, PA. In 1944, these human \\nremains were donated by Mr. Kinbrough to the Dakota Museum, University \\nof South Dakota, Vermillion, SD (now known as the W.H. Over Museum). No \\nknown individual was identified. The 32 associated funerary objects \\ninclude stone projectile points and animal bone tools related to sea \\nand land hunting and fishing.\\n    Based on the geographic location and material culture, this \\nindividual has been identified as Native American, most likely \\naffiliated with the Aleut culture. The determination of cultural \\naffiliation has been based upon the relative geographic isolation of \\nShemya Island, archeological evidence from the Shemya Island region, \\npast and present Aleut oral tradition, historical evidence, and expert \\nanthropological opinion. These forms of evidence all indicate that \\nAleut people were the sole pre-contact (pre-1741 A.D.) occupants of \\nShemya Island.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the 611th \\nAir Force Group, USAF have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the 611th \\nAir Force Group, USAF have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(2), the 32 objects listed above are reasonably believed to \\nhave been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of \\ndeath or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials \\nof the 611th Air Force Group, USAF have determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains \\nand associated funerary objects and the Aleut Corporation, and the \\nPribilof Islands Aleut Communities of St. Paul and St. George Islands.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Aleut Corporation, \\nand the Pribilof Islands Aleut Communities of St. Paul and St. George \\nIslands. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects should contact Captain Christopher A. Pleiman, \\nCultural Resources Manager, 611th Air Support Group, U.S. Air Force, \\n6900 9th Street, Ste. 360, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506-2270; telephone: \\n(907) 552-7442, before February 14, 2000. Repatriation of the human \\nremains and associated funerary objects to the Aleut Corporation, and \\nthe Pribilof Islands Aleut Communities of St. Paul and St. George \\nIslands may begin after that date\\n\\n[[Page 2425]]\\n\\nif no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: December 20, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
