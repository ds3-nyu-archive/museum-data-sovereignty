The human remains were removed from the Lake Cormorant (22.0029/13-P-8) and Irby (22.0030/13-P-10) sites, DeSoto County, MS.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Michigan professional staff in consultation with representatives of The Chickasaw Nation and The Quapaw Tribe of Indians (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Human Remains\\n        In January of 1958, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Lake Cormorant site (22.0029/13-P-8) in DeSoto County, MS. The site is located near the junction of Lake Cormorant and an old meander of the Mississippi River. The property owner described the site as having two mounds, but only one 1-2 foot high mound was present in 1940. Plowing disturbed the site. The site was excavated multiple times by multiple parties. The human remains in the UMMAA\\'s possession were donated by Gregory Perino of the Gilcrease Foundation on February 18, 1958. UMMAA records for these human remains are minimal. The burial is believed to date to the Middle Mississippian Period (A.D. 1200-1500) based on non-burial-related diagnostic artifacts collected from the site. The one individual is an adolescent/young adult 12-20 years old of indeterminate sex, with marked fronto-occipital cranial modification and mild porotic hyperostosis throughout the cranial vault (possibly from mineral deficiencies). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In January of 1958, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Irby site (22.0030/13-P-10) in DeSoto County, MS. The site is located on a natural levee of the Alpike Bayou near a junction with Johnson Creek. The site was described as a single mound of indeterminate shape. The north end of the mound has been plowed and was noted as having a heavy deposit of daub. Daub was also noted as being abundant on the bank west of the mound and scattered throughout an adjacent field. The site has been excavated multiple times by multiple parties. The human remains in the UMMAA\\'s possession were donated by Gregory Perino of the Gilcrease Foundation on February 18, 1958. UMMAA records for these human remains are minimal. The burial is believed to date to within the Late Woodland (Baytown) and Middle Mississippian Periods (A.D. 400-1500) based on non-burial-related diagnostic artifacts collected from the site. The one individual is an adult 30-40 years old and possibly male, with marked fronto-occipital cranial modification, mild porotic hyperostosis throughout the cranial vault (possibly from mineral deficiencies), and a possible depression fracture above the left eye orbit. No known individuals were identified.
