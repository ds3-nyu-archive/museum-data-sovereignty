The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary object. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Kialegee Tribal Town; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town. The Florida Tribe of Eastern Creek Indians and Original Miccosukee Simanolee Nation of Aboriginal People, non-federally recognized Indian groups, were also consulted.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        In 1974, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the FCI Borrow site in Jackson County, FL. The human remains of an infant (approx. one year of age) were encountered during a fill mining excavation at the county-owned FCI Borrow pit. A Jackson County Sheriff\\'s officer was called, and he removed the human remains and one associated funerary object (a shell pendant) from the site prior to notifying the Department of State. Turquoise green glass beads were also noted as being present in the infant burial, but they crumbled when an attempt was made to remove them, and were, therefore, left in situ and not collected. Archaeologist B. Calvin Jones was sent by the Department of State to investigate the site. During his investigation, he collected a small amount of additional material from the site\\'s surface including the human remains belonging to an adult (aged as approx. 20+ years of age). Jones transferred the skeletal remains of these two individuals and the associated funerary object to the Florida Department of State collections in 1974, but they were not formally cataloged until 1993. No known individuals were identified. The associated funerary object recovered from the infant burial is a single shell pendant (Accession #93.163.01.01).\\n        The site has been identified by Archaeologist B. Calvin Jones as the location of a Native American reservation designated by the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek. The political situation at the time of the treaty was unsettled, and Tribes present during the treaty meetings were described in historic accounts as Apalachicola, northern division of the Seminole, Miccosukee, and Lower Creek. Some of the tribal leaders recorded as present during these meetings included Neamathla, Tuskihadjo, Emathlochee, Econchatomico, Yellow Hair, Mulatto King, and John Blount. Descendants of these groups now are members of several Indian Tribes, including the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        Determinations Made by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources\\n        Officials of the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the one object described in this notice is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains the associated funerary object and The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary object should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Kathryn Miyar, Florida Department of State, Mission San Luis Collections, 2100 West Tennessee Street, Tallahassee, FL 32304, telephone (850) 245-6301, email kathryn.miyar@dos.myflorida.com, by June 20, 2018.
