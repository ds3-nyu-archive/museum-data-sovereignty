Museum records indicate that these objects are Wiyot in origin and were collected by Stewart Culin for The Field Museum as part of an expedition co-sponsored by the Museum. Mr. Culin collected objects from what he described as an Indian Rancheria on the Mad River, about a mile away from Blue Lake in the summer of 1900. The one cultural item is a set of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoctor\\'s feathers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that were collected from a Wiyot man named Dick, whose father had been a doctor. The set of doctor\\'s feathers was accessioned by the Field Museum in 1900 and is represented by catalog number 60069. There are seven bundles of condor feathers, which have had their edges trimmed. Some bundles have additional smaller feathers, such as those from a northern flicker, and abalone shells. The feathers would have been used by a doctor in either a healing ceremony or as part of a religious ceremony, including the World Renewal Ceremony. These feathers are imbued and are necessary today for the revitalization and present day practice of Wiyot traditional religion. The Wiyot are culturally affiliated with the area from which the sacred objects were removed.
