Meleen of the Smithsonian \\nInstitution, the Mitchell Lions Club, and the Works Progress \\nAdministration (WPA Project 3159); and a separate recovery in 1954 by \\nMarvin Thome, Mitchell, SD. In 1998, four of these individuals were \\ntransferred from the W.H. Over Museum to SARC. Also in 1998, the \\nindividual recovered in 1954 was transferred from the University of \\nNebraska State Museum to SARC. No known individuals were identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects are present.\\n    Based on manner of interment, these individuals have been \\nidentified as Native American. Based on architecture, artifact \\nassemblage, radiocarbon dates, and ceramics from previous excavations, \\nthe Mitchell Village and Mounds have been identified as Initial Middle \\nMissouri Tradition (900-1400 A.D.). Based on continuities of material \\nculture, architecture, and skeletal morphology, in addition to oral \\ntradition and historical evidence, the Mitchell Village and Mounds have \\nbeen affiliated with the Mandan.\\n    During the early 1930s, human remains representing three \\nindividuals were recovered from an earthlodge cache pit in Twelve Mile \\nCreek Village and Mounds (39HT1) on the north bank\\n\\n[[Page 51142]]\\n\\nof South Fork Twelve Mile Creek, Hutchinson County, SD during non-\\nprofessional excavations conducted by F. Robinson, Dr. J.J. Krall, and \\nH. Hall, Tyndall, SD. These individuals were donated to F.C. Kratz, \\ndirector of the Olivet Museum, and were later transferred to the \\nUniversity of South Dakota Museum-Vermillion (now the W.H. Over \\nMuseum). In 1997, these human remains were transfered to SARC. No known \\nindividuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are \\npresent.\\n    In 1939, human remains representing two individuals were recovered \\nfrom Twelve Mile Creek Village and Mounds (39HT1) on the north bank of \\nSouth Fork Twelve Mile Creek, Hutchinson County, SD during WPA \\nexcavations conducted by E.E. Meleen, Smithsonian Institution, and W.H. \\nOver, USD Museum. In 1998, these human remains were found in SARC \\ncollections. No known individuals were identified. The one associated \\nfunerary object is a coyote tooth.\\n    Based on the manner of interment and the associated funeary object, \\nthese individuals have been identified as Native American. Based on the \\narchitecture, material culture, radiocarbon dates, and ceramics from \\nthe 1930-1939 excavations, the Twelve Mile Village and Mounds have been \\ndated to the Lower James Phase of the Initial Middle Missouri Tradition \\n(900-1350 A.D.). Based on continuities of material culture, \\narchitecture, and skeletal morphology, in addition to oral tradition \\nand historical evidence, the Twelve Mile Village and Mounds have been \\naffiliated with the Mandan.\\n    In 1870, the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes were moved to the \\nFort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and are now known \\ncollectively as the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the South \\nDakota State Archaeological Research Center have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above \\nrepresent the physical remains of ten individuals of Native American \\nancestry. Officials of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research \\nCenter have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the \\none object listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed \\nwith or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as \\npart of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the South \\nDakota State Archaeological Research Center have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these Native American \\nhuman remains and associated funerary object and the Three Affiliated \\nTribes of North Dakota.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Three Affiliated \\nTribes of North Dakota. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary object should contact Renee Boen, Curator, \\nState Archaeological Center, South Dakota Historical Society, P.O. Box \\n1257, Rapid City, SD 57709-1257; telephone: (605) 394-1936, before \\nOctober 21, 1999. Repatriation of the human remains and associated \\nfunerary object to the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota may \\nbegin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: September 14, 1999.\\nVeletta Canouts,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nDeputy Manager, Archeology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 99-24475 Filed 9-20-99; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
