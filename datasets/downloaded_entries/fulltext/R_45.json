The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item\\n        In 1903, one cultural item was removed from Pine Point in Becker County, MN, by John K. West, an entrepreneur from western Massachusetts, who arrived in Detroit Lakes in 1881 with his wife, Ms. Jessie Campbell West. Both individuals spent considerable time in Detroit Lakes and other areas within Becker County and acquired numerous objects from White Earth Reservation. Shortly after Ms. West\\'s death in January 1903, several objects were sent to Massachusetts and were acquired by the Berkshire Museum. The one sacred object/object of cultural patrimony is described as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOjibwa large drum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (#C1992.53) otherwise referred to as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Drum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManidoo Dewe\\'igan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (meaning \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpirit Drum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n        The Pine Point community, where this particular drum originated, is within the boundaries of Becker County on the White Earth Reservation. From the creation of the White Earth Reservation in 1867 through the mid-1900s, the people of White Earth existed often under great hardship due to significant economic, cultural, and religious oppression combined with well-documented dispossession of land and other resources. Historically, the Big Drum served an important role in maintaining peace between communities and such drums continue to hold a spiritual and healing role with ceremonies that are still held on the White Earth Reservation. In addition, the ongoing historical and spiritual importance of these drums is that they are central to the White Earth people as a whole and could never have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual regardless of whether or not the individual was a member of the tribe. Thomas Vennum wrote in The Ojibwa Dance Drum, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause song and dance are traditionally considered to be sacred in origin they are for Native Americans a form of prayer . . . and because most song is accompanied by percussion of some sort\\xe2\\x80\\x94drums more often than not\\xe2\\x80\\x94the instruments themselves become sacred through their associations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This feeling was reaffirmed by the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe during consultation with the Berkshire Museum. In a letter dated April 5, 2017, the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe requested the return of the Big Drum due to its substantial cultural and religious significance.\\n        Determinations Made by the Berkshire Museum\\n        Officials of the Berkshire Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the one cultural item described above is a specific ceremonial object needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the one cultural item described above has ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred object and object of cultural patrimony and the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Jason Vivori, Collections Experience Manager, Berkshire Museum, 39 South Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201, telephone (413) 443-7171 ext. 341, email jvivori@berkshiremuseum.org, by August 13, 2018.
