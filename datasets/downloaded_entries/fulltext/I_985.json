Nine burials were reported to have been excavated from the Pictograph Cave, while only five human bones and one tooth were reported from the Ghost Cave (Snodgrasse 1958). These remains from an excavated context are attributed to the Late Prehistoric occupation of the caves, dating between A.D. 500 and 1750 (Mulloy 1958 and Snodgrasse 1958).\\n        The University of Wyoming, Department of Anthropology, acquired human remains from the Pictograph Cave representing, at minimum, three individuals, all sub-adults, sometime in the late 1940s. In 1991, the Museum of the Rockies acquired human teeth from the Pictograph Cave, its Terrace area, and the Ghost Cave representing, at minimum, four individuals, as part of a large donation of unrelated material. The University of Montana acquired human remains representing, at minimum, 11 individuals at an unknown date from the Pictograph Cave, its Terrace area, and the Ghost Cave. Some of the individuals held by the different institutions may be duplicative, in which case the minimum number would be lower. The human remains in the possession of the University of Montana were found in the faunal collections from these locations, and include fifteen elements from the Pictograph Cave (a left distal femur epiphysis of a sub-adult, a right 4th premolar, two right metatarsals, a right 3rd cuneiform, a left clavicle, a cervical vertebra, two proximal phalanges, a right parietal fragment, a left mandibular canine, a right talus, a right calcaneus, a left calcaneus, and a right cuboid), two elements from the Terrace area (a partial femur and a partial os coxae), and a single element from the Ghost Cave (a fragmentary rib).
