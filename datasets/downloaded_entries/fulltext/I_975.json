According to museum and archival documents, the remains were discovered in a cave near an ancient battleground north of the Hiwassee River. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from an unknown location near the town of Ellijay, along the Ellijay River, in Gilmer County, GA, by an unknown individual. Museum documentation indicates the remains were not buried and may have been removed from a cave or rock-shelter context. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Dr. Joel Martin, U.S. Army Medical Director at Fort Cass, obtained all of the remains above sometime after May 16, 1838, but prior to August 1, 1838. Dr. Martin subsequently sent the remains to Dr. Samuel G. Morton, who accessioned these remains into his collection prior to 1839. From approximately 1830 until Dr. Morton\\'s death in 1851, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia provided storage space for Dr. Morton\\'s collection.\\n        At an unknown date prior to June 1846, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from a mound in Cherokee County, NC, by Dr. James F.E. Hardy of Asheville, NC. Dr. Hardy sent the remains to Dr. Samuel G. Morton for inclusion in his study of human crania. Dr. Morton donated the remains to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia on June 9, 1846. Archival documentation describes one of the individuals as \\xe2\\x80\\x9can Indian well known in the County * * * He was one of the greatest ball players in his tribe. While playing ball he slipped & fell & dislocated his spine & died immediately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Museum documentation and a physical assessment of the remains identified trauma consistent with the injuries in this account and injuries one might receive while playing the Cherokee stickball game. Historical records and consultation information give accounts of men being seriously injured and dying while playing the Cherokee stickball game. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1853, Dr. Morton\\'s collection, including all of the remains described above, was purchased from Dr. Morton\\'s estate and formally presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1966, Dr. Morton\\'s collection was loaned to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. In 1997, the collection was formally gifted to the University of Pennsylvania Museum.\\n        The human remains have been identified as Native American based on the specific cultural and geographic attribution in the museum records. Collector\\'s records, museum documentation, and published sources (Morton 1839, 1840, and 1849; Meigs 1857) identify the human remains above as Cherokee. According to consultation information, historically, the Cherokee buried their deceased; however, certain circumstances may have prevented this from happening. Thus, consultation and archival documentation reveal that human remains found in cave or rock shelter contexts are not uncommon during the Historic Period when forced removal and epidemics resulted in the deaths of many Cherokee individuals beginning in 1735 through the Removal Period. Scholarly publications, land cession records, and consultation information indicate that the areas from which the human remains were removed are within the traditional aboriginal territory of the Cherokee Indians and many known historic Cherokee occupation sites within these areas have been identified.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\\n        Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of six individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Cherokee Nation; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Julian Siggers, Director, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, 3260 South Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, telephone (215) 898-4050, before April 29, 2013.
