The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Haffenreffer Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head, the Mashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian group); the Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island; and the Council of Seven/Royal House of Pokanoket/Pokanoket Tribe/Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian group). \\n        In 1913, human remains representing one individual were excavated at Burr\\'s Hill in Warren, RI. During the 1920\\'s, Rudolf Haffenreffer acquired these remains as part of the Drown collection. No known individual was identified. The seven associated funerary objects are five small brass kettle fragments and two wool blanket fragments. \\n        Burr\\'s Hill is believed to be located on the southern border of Sowams, a Wampanoag village. Sowams is identified in historic documents of the 17th and 18th centuries as a Wampanoag village, and was ceded to the English in 1653 by Massasoit and his eldest son Wamsutta (Alexander). Sporadic finds and excavations have been made at this site from the middle of the 19th century through the early 20th century. Based the presence of European trade goods and types of cultural items, these cultural items have been dated to between A.D. 1600-1710. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the seven objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head, the Mashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian group). This notice has been sent to officials of the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head, the Mashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian group); the Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island; and the Council of Seven/Royal House of Pokanoket/Pokanoket Tribe/Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian group). Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated funerary objects should contact Thierry Gentis, NAGPRA Coordinator, Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Mount Hope Grant, Bristol, RI 02805, telephone (401) 253-8388, facsimile (401) 253-1198, before November 3, 2000. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head, the Mashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian group) may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: September 21, 2000. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 00-25398 Filed 10-03-00; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown University, Bristol, RI ", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.
