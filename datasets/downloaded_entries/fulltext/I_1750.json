The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary object.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Alma College professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan.\\n        On March 13, 1920, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a burial in sec. 5, T. 11 N., R. 3 W.

The one associated funerary object is a pontel glass bottle that dates to circa 1740-1780.\\n        The location of the site is consistent with the historically documented territory of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan during the 18th and 19th centuries.\\n        Officials of Alma College have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.
