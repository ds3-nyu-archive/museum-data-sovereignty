The human remains and associated funerary object were removed from Dutch Harbor, Amaknak Island, Aleutians East Borough, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

These human remains were collected by Charles Joseph Zemalis, who was enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the time, and accessioned by the Burke Museum in 1946 (Burke Accn. #3427). The accession record noted the human remains came from 30 inches beneath the surface in a midden, along with a bone point.\\n        In 1974, several sets of human remains, including Burke Accn. #3427, were transferred to Seattle University from the Burke Museum. Sometime after that, the human remains were supposedly found in a warehouse and were later given to the New York State Police by a woman who claimed her deceased husband found the human remains in Seattle. The human remains were then given to the Washington State Physical Anthropologist Dr. Guy Tasa, who determined that the human remains were originally from the Burke Museum\\'s collection and returned them to the Burke in 2010. No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is a bone point, which has been in the Burke\\'s collections since 1946.\\n        The human remains have been determined to be Native American based on osteological and archeological evidence. While the exact site from which these human remains were removed is unknown, the area around Unalaska Bay and Dutch Harbor has numerous documented archeological sites occupied by the Aleut (Unangan) people (Damas, 1984; McCartney, 1998). Most of these sites are deep midden deposits that date from historic times back 4000 years. During World War II, many of these sites, especially on Amaknak Island, were impacted by military projects, and soldiers were known to have collected material (McCartney, 1998). The one bone point funerary object is consistent with material culture from the region and time period (Damas, 1984; McCartney, 1998). The modern day descendants of the Unalaska Bay Aleut (Unangan) are members of the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska.\\n        Determinations Made by the Burke Museum\\n        Officials of the Burke Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the one object described in this notice is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary object and the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary object should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Peter Lape, Burke Museum, University of Washington, Box 353101, Seattle, WA 98195, telephone (206) 685-3849 x2, email plape@uw.edu, by May 28, 2015.
