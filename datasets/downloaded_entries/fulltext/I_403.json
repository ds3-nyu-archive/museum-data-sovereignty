The human remains were initially discovered in the fall of 1982 during construction and maintenance of the Texas State University campus. Osteological analysis was conducted by a biological anthropologist from the Southwest Texas State University Department of Sociology and Anthropology (now Texas State University Department of Anthropology), who determined by the context and appearance of the remains that they are most likely of prehistoric Native American ancestry. The human remains from the first burial were very fragmentary. Age and sex could not be determined. The human remains from the second burial were determined to be those of an adult female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In February of 2008 and April of 2009, human remains representing, at minimum, four individuals were removed from site 40HY163 in Hays County, TX. The human remains were discovered during a construction project for expansion of the City of San Marcos\\' Wonder World Drive and later excavated by Texas State University\\'s Center for Archaeological Studies. Osteological analysis was conducted Kyra Stull, M.A. and Dr. Michelle Hamilton of the Department of Anthropology at Texas State University, who determined them to be of prehistoric Native American ancestry.
