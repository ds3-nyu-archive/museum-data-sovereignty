The human remains were removed from Cherni Island, Aleutians East Borough, AK, in 1952, which was managed by the BLM at that time. The human remains have since been stored at the Field Museum.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Alaska State Office, BLM professional staff in consultation with representatives of Agdaagux Tribe of King Cove; Native Village of Belkofski; Native Village of False Pass; Native Village of Nelson Lagoon; Pauloff Harbor Village; Qagan Tayagungin Tribe of Sand Point Village; and the Native Village of Unga (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        In 1952, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from Cherni Island, AK. According to Field Museum records, the human remains were removed by Robert Jones, Jr. of Cold Bay, AK, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and presented to the museum in 1953. The human remains were subsequently stored by the museum and remain at that facility. In 2008, in an effort to determine control of the human remains, the Field Museum contacted the Alaska State Office, BLM concerning ownership of Cherni Island in 1952. Based on BLM land records, the land from which the remains were collected was under BLM management in 1952, and had been until 1984, when the lands were conveyed to Native Alaskan allottees. Because the land was managed by the BLM at the time the human remains were collected, the Alaska State Office, BLM assumed control of the collection for the purposes of NAGPRA. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Based on geographical location, condition, and morphology, the human remains are determined to be Native American. Cherni Island is a small, presently uninhabited, island located about 25 miles south of King Cove, AK, in the Aleutians East Borough. Due to the continuity of populations for thousands of years in the eastern Aleutian Islands, as demonstrated by archeological studies and oral traditions, the human remains represent an individual likely to be directly related to Native American tribal members who reside today in the same geographic location.\\n        Determinations Made by the Alaska State Office, Bureau of Land Management\\n        Officials of the Alaska State Office, BLM have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and members of The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. Robert E.
