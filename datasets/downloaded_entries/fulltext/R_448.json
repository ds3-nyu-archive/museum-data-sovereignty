The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the NAGPRA coordinator, Intermountain Region.\\n        In 1994, the National Park Service assisted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service with the investigation of a Migratory Bird Treaty Act violation. The evidence included a collection of Native American objects confiscated from the East-West Trading Post in Santa Fe, NM. Preliminary subject matter expert review of the collection indicated that the objects were historically significant and potentially subject to NAGPRA. The collection was accessioned in 2002 into the Southwest Regional Office collections, now called the Intermountain Region Office. The three cultural items covered in this notice are one set of wooden figures, one chest plate, and one Zuni constellation set.\\n        Following adjudication of the case, a detailed assessment of the objects was made by Intermountain Region (IMR) NAGPRA program staff in close collaboration with the IMR Museum Services program staff and in consultation with representatives of potentially affiliated tribes. During consultation, a representative of the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, identified the cultural items as specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Zuni religious leaders for the practice of a traditional Native American religion by their present-day adherents. Oral tradition evidence presented by representatives of the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, and the written repatriation request received by the Intermountain Region further articulated the ceremonial significance of the cultural items to the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. Based on anthropological information, court case documentation, oral tradition, museum records, consultation evidence, and expert opinion, there is a cultural affiliation between the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, and the three sacred objects.\\n        Officials of the Intermountain Region have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C), the three cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. Officials of the Intermountain Region also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the sacred objects should contact Dave Ruppert, NAGPRA Coordinator, NPS Intermountain Region, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, CO 80228, telephone (303) 969-2879, before August 18, 2008. Repatriation of the sacred objects to the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The Intermountain Region is responsible for notifying the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (formerly the Pueblo of San Juan); Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: June 24, 2008\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
