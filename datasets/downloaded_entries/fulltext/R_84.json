Museum records indicate that these cultural items are Quinault in origin, and were collected by Reverend Myron Eells on behalf of the Washington World\\'s Fair Commission for display at the World\\'s Columbian Exposition. The two sacred objects are tamahnousing figures, and were accessioned by The Field Museum of Natural History in 1893. One sacred object is a red painted wooden anthropomorphic figure with rattles around its neck (cat. 19789). The figure represents the spirit djilo\\'tsanomic, who helped heal soul loss and would have been used by a shaman. The second sacred object is a cedar bark figure with attached rattles (cat. 19645).
