In 1990, these \\nindividuals were transferred to KSHS by Fort Hays University as \\nrequired by the Kansas Unmarked Burials Sites Preservation Act. Efforts \\nto contact the Maranville family regarding this loan have been \\nunsuccessful. No known individuals were identified. The 401 associated \\nfunerary objects include a mirror, two knives, two files, a bell, a \\ncomb, 44 glass and metal buttons, eleven brass circlets, three metal \\ncone clusters, three metal buckles, on length of brass wire, one silver \\nplaque, 39 silver conchos, five metal arrowheads, and 287 glass beads.\\n    According to the FHSU museum exhibit label, the grave of these \\nindividuals was lined with cedar poles. In a written 1973 statement, a \\nmember of the Maranville family described the burial as an ``Indian \\ngrave\\'\\' consisting of two seated skeletons. Based on the associated \\nfunerary objects and reported manner of interment, these individuals \\nhave been identified as Native American. The FHSU museum exhibit label \\nalso states that local legend indicates these were Cheyenne individuals \\nkilled in the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and brought to Walnut Creek \\nfor burial.\\n    In 1912, human remains representing one individual were donated to \\nKSHS by R. K. Farrar. No known individual was identified. No associated \\nfunerary objects are present.\\n    Donor information indicates this individual was removed from the \\n1875 Cheyenne Massacre site derived from the Cheyenne Hole or Sappa \\nCreek Battle on the Middle Fork of Sappa Creek, Rawlins County, KS and \\nidentified by the donor as Cheyenne. In 1980, archeological \\ninvestigations identified not only the 1875 component, but also a \\nprecontact habitation site dating to the Great Bend Aspect (1400--1600 \\nA.D.). Based upon condition of the human remains and donor information, \\nthis individual has been identified as Cheyenne.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Kansas \\nState Historical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the \\nKansas State Historical Society have also determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the 401 objects listed above are reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \\nLastly, officials of the Kansas State Historical Society have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nNative American human remains and associated funerary objects and the \\nCheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Cheyenne-Arapaho \\nTribes of Oklahoma, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern \\nCheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana. Representatives of any other \\nIndian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with \\nthese human remains and associated funerary objects should contact \\nRandall Thies, Archeologist, Kansas State Historical Society, 6425 SW \\nSixth Avenue, Topeka, KS 66606-1099; telephone: (913) 272-8681, ext. \\n267, before April 15, 1999. Repatriation of the human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma \\nmay begin\\n\\n[[Page 13034]]\\n\\nafter that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: March 9, 1999.\\nVeletta Canouts,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nDeputy Manager, Archeology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 99-6308 Filed 3-15-99; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
