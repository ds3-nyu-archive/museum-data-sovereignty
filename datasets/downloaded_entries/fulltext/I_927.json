The human remains and associated funerary objects are in the physical custody of the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, AZ. No known individuals were identified. The 19 associated funerary objects are 9 animal bones, 1 piece of charred cotton cloth, 1 axe, 1 pitcher fragment, 1 Walnut black-on-white mug, 1 Tsegi red-on-orange ladle, 1 Sunset red bowl, 1 Turkey Hill red jar, 2 obsidian projectile points, and 1 piece of charcoal.\\n        On the basis of architecture and ceramics, Nalakihu Pueblo is dated to A.D. 1150-1300. The human remains, a cremation, have been analyzed by physical anthropologists who have determined them to be Native American. The burial was excavated immediately east of and contemporaneous with the site. Incineration occurred on a pyre or platform over a shallow, rectangular basin with a circular pit in the center. Four poles, slanted inward, intersected at about 4 feet above the central pit. The entire pit showed evidence of burning, indicating that the cremation occurred at that location. The cremation method is highly unusual for the Flagstaff and Wupatki areas but is reminiscent of mortuary practices of the lower Colorado River tribes such as the historic Quechan, Halchidohoma, Maricopa, Mojave, and/or Cocopah. The associated funerary objects are similar to Hopi and Zuni objects.\\n        Determinations Made by Wupatki National Monument\\n        Officials of Wupatki National Monument have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 19 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Cocopah Tribe of Arizona; Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, Arizona and California; Fort Mojave Indian Tribe of Arizona, California & Nevada; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, California & Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Lisa Leap, Acting Superintendent, Wupatki National Monument, 6400 N Hwy 89, Flagstaff, AZ 86004, telephone (928) 526-1157 ext. 222, email lisa_leap@nps.gov, by September 16, 2013.
