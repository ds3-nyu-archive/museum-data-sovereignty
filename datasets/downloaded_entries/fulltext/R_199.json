A number of the sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony from this site were previously on loan to San Francisco State University and Novato Museum of Prehistory. In 1975, the cultural items from the Novato Museum of Prehistory were transferred to Tiberon Landmark Society, and in 1997, the items were returned to the Archaeological Collections Facility, Sonoma State University.

The 168 objects of cultural patrimony are 4 antler tools, 1 Haliotis shell pendant, 1 shell bead blank, 14 bone tools, 1 bone pendant/spatula, 4 bone tubes, 25 pieces modified bone, 40 obsidian tools, 22 worked/utilized obsidian flakes, 9 chert tools, 1 piece worked chert, and 46 pieces groundstone.\\n        Radiocarbon tests from the Reedland Woods site yielded dates between 370 to 190 B.C. and 30 to 95 B.C.
