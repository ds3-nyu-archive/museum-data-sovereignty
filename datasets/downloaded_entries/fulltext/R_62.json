The other two items lack sufficient context to date them.\\n        At some time prior to 1956, two cultural items were removed from a burial context at an unspecified site in the Dove Creek area in Dolores County, CO, by Virgil Mathews. The cultural items were donated to History Colorado in 1956. The two unassociated funerary objects are 1 black-on-white pitcher, and 1 grayware bowl. The associated human remains were not collected. Pottery attributes of the two items indicate they were made in the Pueblo II period, A.D. 900-1150.\\n        At some time prior to 1967, one cultural item was removed from a burial context at an unspecified site in Montezuma Canyon, San Juan County, UT, by an unknown person, later purchased by Vida Ellison, and willed to History Colorado in 1967 as part of an archeological collection. The one unassociated funerary object is 1 mud ware bowl. Pottery attributes indicate it was made in the Basketmaker III period, A.D. 500-750.\\n        At some time prior to 1987, one cultural item was removed by an unknown person from a burial context at an unspecified site and accessioned into the History Colorado collection in 1987.

Pottery attributes indicate it was made in the Pueblo II period, A.D. 900-1150.\\n        At an unknown date, two cultural items were removed from burial contexts at unspecified sites and placed into the History Colorado collection. The two cultural items are 1 turkey feather blanket fragment and 1 corrugated cooking jar. Attributes of both cultural items indicate they were made in the Pueblo I-III period, A.D. 750-1300.\\n        The cultural affiliation of these unassociated funerary objects with present-day Native Americans was determined through the use of the following lines of evidence: geographical, kinship, biological, archeological, anthropological, linguistic, oral tradition, historical and expert opinion. Evidence was gathered from consultations with Indian Tribes, physical examination, survey of acquisition history, review of pertinent archeological, ethnographic, historic, anthropological and linguistic literature, and artifact analysis. Similarities in site architecture and material culture associated with the unassociated funerary objects are consistent with Ancestral Puebloan occupation of the southwestern United States, from the Basketmaker I period through the Pueblo III period (between approximately 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1300). Ancestral Puebloan ceramic typologies and perishables analyses helped to identify chronological and geographical technological traditions. After approximately A.D. 1300, multiple factors caused Pueblo populations to leave the Four Corners region and resettle in Pueblos along the Northern Rio Grande and in the Pueblos of Acoma, Zuni, Ysleta del Sur, and Hopi. Extant oral traditions corroborate dynamic population movements within the region during this time.\\n        Determinations Made by History Colorado\\n        Officials of History Colorado have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), and based on existing museum documentation, the 222 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo); Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of San Juan); Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (previously listed as the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Culturally Affiliated Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Sheila Goff, NAGPRA Liaison, History Colorado, 1200 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203, telephone (303) 866-4531, email sheila.goff@state.co.us, by March 1, 2018.

Pottery attributes indicate the cultural items were made during the Basketmaker III/Pueblo I periods, A.D. 500-900. \n At some time prior to 1943, four cultural items were removed from burial contexts at unspecified sites in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, or Utah by James Mellinger. Mr. Mellinger willed his collection to History Colorado in 1943, and it was transferred to History Colorado in 1967. The four unassociated funerary objects are 1 grayware jar and 1 black-on-white bowl from Blue Mesa, CO, 1 turkey feather blanket from an unspecified site, and 1 twill-plaited basket from the Grand Gulch, UT, area. The associated human remains were not collected. Pottery attributes of two items indicate they were made in the Basketmaker/Pueblo I period, A.D. 500-900. The other two items lack sufficient context to date them. \n At some time prior to 1956, two cultural items were removed from a burial context at an unspecified site in the Dove Creek area in Dolores County, CO, by Virgil Mathews. The cultural items were donated to History Colorado in 1956. The two unassociated funerary objects are 1 black-on-white pitcher, and 1 grayware bowl. The associated human remains were not collected. Pottery attributes of the two items indicate they were made in the Pueblo II period, A.D. 900-1150. \n At some time prior to 1967, one cultural item was removed from a burial context at an unspecified site in Montezuma Canyon, San Juan County, UT, by an unknown person, later purchased by Vida Ellison, and willed to History Colorado in 1967 as part of an archeological collection. The one unassociated funerary object is 1 mud ware bowl. Pottery attributes indicate it was made in the Basketmaker III period, A.D. 500-750. \n At some time prior to 1987, one cultural item was removed by an unknown person from a burial context at an unspecified site and accessioned into the History Colorado collection in 1987. The unassociated funerary object is 1 black-on-white seed jar. The associated remains were not collected. Pottery attributes indicate it was made in the Pueblo II period, A.D. 900-1150. \n At an unknown date, two cultural items were removed from burial contexts at unspecified sites and placed into the History Colorado collection. The two cultural items are 1 turkey feather blanket fragment and 1 corrugated cooking jar. Attributes of both cultural items indicate they were made in the Pueblo I-III period, A.D. 750-1300. \n The cultural affiliation of these unassociated funerary objects with present-day Native Americans was determined through the use of the following lines of evidence: geographical, kinship, biological, archeological, anthropological, linguistic, oral tradition, historical and expert opinion. Evidence was gathered from consultations with Indian Tribes, physical examination, survey of acquisition history, review of pertinent archeological, ethnographic, historic, anthropological and linguistic literature, and artifact analysis. Similarities in site architecture and material culture associated with the unassociated funerary objects are consistent with Ancestral Puebloan occupation of the southwestern United States, from the Basketmaker I period through the Pueblo III period (between approximately 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1300). Ancestral Puebloan ceramic typologies and perishables analyses helped to identify chronological and geographical technological traditions. After approximately A.D. 1300, multiple factors caused Pueblo populations to leave the Four Corners region and resettle in Pueblos along the Northern Rio Grande and in the Pueblos of Acoma, Zuni, Ysleta del Sur, and Hopi. Extant oral traditions corroborate dynamic population movements within the region during this time. \n Determinations Made by History Colorado \n Officials of History Colorado have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), and based on existing museum documentation, the 222 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo); Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of San Juan); Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (previously listed as the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Culturally Affiliated Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \n Additional Requestors and Disposition \n Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Sheila Goff, NAGPRA Liaison, History Colorado, 1200 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203, telephone (303) 866-4531, email sheila.goff@state.co.us, by March 1, 2018.
