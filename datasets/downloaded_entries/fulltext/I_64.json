MSP Officer Gaylord was dispatched to a private residence in Cheboygan, MI, following the report of a possible bone found laying between the driveway and the shoulder of the roadway. Upon arrival, the officer examined the human remains and sent a photo to the Mclaren Hospital, which determined that it was human. The bone is approximately 12 inches long with a cut/slot in the ball/shoulder end and a hole in the elbow end. The bone was transferred to Dr. Todd Fenton and his then student Caitlin Vogelsberg for analysis. They concluded the bone\\xe2\\x80\\x94a humerus\\xe2\\x80\\x94was prehistoric Native American in origin, based on FORDISC 3.1 (Jantz and Ousley 2005) and a five-way discriminant function analysis algorithm. The human remains are probably female, based on epicondylar breadth, maximum length, and vertical head diameter (Dittrick and Suchey 1986), and belong to an adult over the age of 15, based on epiphyseal fusion (Baker, Dupras, and Tocheri 2005). There is noted slight osteoarthritic lipping on the humeral head border (Ortner 2003). The stature was calculated on FORDISC as well, noting the individual to be 60.9-67.0 inches tall. Following analysis, the human remains (MSP073-000-3548-14) were returned to MSP custody. No known individuals were identified.
