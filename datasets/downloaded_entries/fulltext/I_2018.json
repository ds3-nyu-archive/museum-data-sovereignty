The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the American Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community of Wisconsin Potawatomi Indians, Wisconsin; Hannahville Indian Community of Wisconsin Potawatomie Indians of Michigan; Huron Potawatomi, Inc., Michigan; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians of Michigan; and Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians, Kansas. \\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals from the vicinity of Peru, La Salle County, IL, were obtained by the Giffort brothers. The American Museum of Natural History has no information regarding who collected these remains or their collection date. The American Museum of Natural History acquired these remains as a purchase from the Giffort brothers in 1896. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        These individuals have been identified as Native American based on the American Museum of Natural History\\'s catalog description, which refers to the remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPottawatomie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and on cranial morphology. The remains originate from within the postcontact territory of the Potawatomi Indians. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the American Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the American Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community of Wisconsin Potawatomi Indians, Wisconsin; Hannahville Indian Community of Wisconsin Potawatomie Indians of Michigan; Huron Potawatomi, Inc., Michigan; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians of Michigan; and Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians, Kansas. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community of Wisconsin Potawatomi Indians, Wisconsin; Hannahville Indian Community of Wisconsin Potawatomie Indians of Michigan; Huron Potawatomi, Inc., Michigan; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians of Michigan; and Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians, Kansas.
