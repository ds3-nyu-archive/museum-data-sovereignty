The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Sometime between 1936 and 1951, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1951.352-.355 & F1997.60.2) were removed from the Beaumier Farm site (47-BR-0060) in Brown County, WI. Robert Hall collected the fragmentary human remains from the surface of a disturbed context. In 1951, Hall donated the human remains to the State Historical Society. The human remains were determined to represent an adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are a copper awl (1951.356), a copper fragment (1951.357), and a string of buckskin with rolled copper fragments (1951.358).\\n        In 1990, 1991, and 1992, human remains representing, at minimum, twelve individuals (HP.BR-0222.1) were removed from the Bordeleau site (47-BR-0222) in Brown County, WI. The human remains were disturbed by plowing activities, and subsequently collected from the surface by Jim Yinst of the Neville Public Museum. In 1995, the remains from each surface collection were transferred from the Neville Public Museum to the State Historical Society\\'s Burial Sites Office. The human remains were determined to represent eight adults and four subadults, all of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1987, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals (HP.BR-0434.1) were removed from the Nicolet Grove site (47-BR-0434) in Brown County, WI. The human remains were disturbed by residential construction on the site. A local real estate broker contacted the Neville Public Museum about the human remains and they, in turn, contacted the State Historical Society\\'s Burial Sites Office. Neville Museum staff archeologists excavated the disturbed remains and transferred them to the State Historical Society. State Historical Society staff archeologists surveyed the site and no additional remains were discovered. The human remains were determined to represent an infant, an adolescent, and an adult, all of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In 1995, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (HP.BR-0440.1) were removed from the Seymour Burial site (47-BR-0440) in Brown County, WI. The human remains were discovered along an eroding riverbank by the property owners. The property owners removed the human remains and contacted the Brown County Sheriff\\'s Department, who, in turn, contacted the State Historical Society\\'s Burial Sites Office. A staff archeologist investigated the site and no additional human remains were discovered. Later that same year, the property owners discovered additional human remains in water at the foot of the bank. These remains were given to the Brown County Sheriff\\'s Department and then transferred to the State Historical Society. The remains were determined to represent one adult Native American male.
