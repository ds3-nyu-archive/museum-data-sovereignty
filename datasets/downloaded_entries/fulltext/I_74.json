The site, located on private property was initially surveyed by E.B. Jelks and E.H. Moorman in 1953, for the River Basin Surveys project. The site was later excavated from March 7, 1968 to August 28, 1968, prior to the inundation of Lake Granbury. The burial was found in November 1968, while the site was being destroyed for construction of a dam. The burial was uncovered outside of the original excavation area as a result of plowing by a pay scraper. The well-preserved human remains belong to an adult male. When found, the backbones were oriented north and south, with the head facing south. Whether the individual was in an extended or flexed position is unknown. The ribs were facing east, indicating that the individual was placed on their left side. The burial was located six to eight feet below the surface in sandy fill with a six to eight inch layer of limestone fragments. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are one point, one scraper, and one dart point. Because the burial was disturbed by a scraper plow, the location of associated funerary objects in relation to the human remains is unknown.\\n        The site is dated to A.D. 1000 to 1200, based on the presence of Scallorn, and Perdiz points in the occupation area of the site. The original excavators determined that the people who occupied the Lowden site were Caddoan.\\n        Determinations Made by the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University\\n        Officials of the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the three objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to B.
