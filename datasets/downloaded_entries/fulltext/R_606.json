The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these cultural items.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        The cultural item is an Apache Gahe (Crown Dancer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) mask.  This mask is made of painted wood, hide (buckskin), feathers, cloth, and metal.\\n        The mask was purchased by Paul Pletka in New Mexico.  No other information regarding the date or circumstances of its acquisition is known.  Mr. Pletka donated the mask to the Museum of Western Colorado in 1975.\\n        Through consultations with members of the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona and the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico, the mask has been identified as a specific ceremonial object needed by the Mescalero Apache Tribe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional religion.  Independent research conducted by the museum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s professional staff, including discussions with the donor, support this assessment.\\n        Officials of the Museum of Western Colorado have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001, Sec. 2 (3)(C), this cultural item is a specific ceremonial object needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.  Officials of the Museum of Western Colorado also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001, Sec. 2 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the mask and the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this sacred object should contact Judy Prosser-Armstrong, Curator of Archives, Librarian and Registrar, Museum of Western Colorado, P.O.
