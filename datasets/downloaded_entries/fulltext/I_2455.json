No associated funerary objects were \\nidentified. Five bone fragments representing one individual were \\nrecovered from Hidatsa Site (32ME10). Two partial human teeth \\nrepresenting one individual were recovered from Sakakawea Site \\n(32ME11). One bone fragment representing 1 individual was recovered \\nfrom Scovill site (32ME409). Two bone fragments representing one \\nindividual were recovered from Long Ridge Cemetery Site (32ME479). \\nThree bone fragments, 1 tooth fragment, and 1 molar tooth representing \\none individual were recovered from Soni Site (32ME492). One bone \\nfragment representing one individual was recovered from Ramble Site \\n(32ME496). Two concentrations of bone fragments and 1 tooth \\nrepresenting one individual were recovered from Small Site (32ME498). \\nThree bone fragments, two teeth fragments, and one molar tooth \\nrepresenting one individual were recovered from Sakakawea Cemetery Site \\n(32ME493). Four bone fragments and one tooth surface representing one \\nindividual were recovered from Buchfink Burial Area (32ME411). No known \\nindividuals were identified.\\n    Each of these nine sites has been identified as being within the \\nHidatsa\\'s traditional occupation area based on cultural continuities, \\nhistoric written records, and consultation with the Three Affiliated \\nTribes. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nNational Park Service have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 \\n(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the \\nThree Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Three Affiliated \\nTribes. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact \\nChas Cartwright, Superintendent, Knife River Indian Villages National \\nHistoric Site, PO Box 9, Stanton, ND 58571, telephone--(701)745-3309, \\nbefore September 11, 1995. Repatriation of the human remains the Three \\nAffiliated Tribes of North Dakota will begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: August 7, 1995\\nFrancis P.
