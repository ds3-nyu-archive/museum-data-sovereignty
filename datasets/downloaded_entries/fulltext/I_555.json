The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana (previously listed as the Chippewa-Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana); Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota (Six component reservations: Bois Forte Band (Nett Lake); Fond du Lac Band; Grand Portage Band; Leech Lake Band; Mille Lacs Band; White Earth Band); Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; Wyandotte Nation; and with the Michigan Anishinaabek Cultural Preservation & Repatriation Alliance, a non-federally recognized entity, representing the following federally recognized tribes: Bay Mills Indian Community, Michigan; Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Michigan; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Michigan; Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Michigan; Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan; Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan; Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, Michigan (previously listed as the Huron Potawatomi, Inc.); Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan; and the Sault Ste.

The human remains were removed by Lieutenant Montgomery C. Meigs during the construction of Fort Wayne by the Army Corps of Engineers. The area selected for the Fort was the site of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprehistoric complex of earthworks, especially burial mounds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Grosscup 1999: 332).\\n        The Springwells Mound Group as it is known is represented by three mounds, the mound located near the Springwells Copper Works (Michigan site number WN-3), the Fort Wayne Mound (WN-1), and the Central Mound (WN-5) located just east of Fort Wayne. Another mound directly opposite (Carsten Mound) and the Great Mound at the mouth of the Rouge River probably relate to the mounds at Springwells. These human remains likely originated from one of the three mounds located on or near Fort Wayne. The mounds date to early-late Late Woodland Periods. The human remains include the cranium and mandible of a single female estimated to be 35-50 years old.\\n        Lt. Meigs sent the human remains to Dr. Samuel G. Morton for inclusion in his study of human crania prior to 1846. In 1853, Dr. Morton\\'s collection, including the human remains described above, was purchased from Dr. Morton\\'s estate and formally presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1966, Dr. Morton\\'s collection was loaned to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. In 1997, the collection was formally gifted to the University of Pennsylvania Museum. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\\n        Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on their examination by a physical anthropologist, their recovery from a known archeological site complex, museum documents, and published records.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of The Consulted Tribes and The Invited Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to The Consulted Tribes and The Invited Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Julian Siggers, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 3260 South Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, telephone (215) 898-4050 by June 10, 2016.
