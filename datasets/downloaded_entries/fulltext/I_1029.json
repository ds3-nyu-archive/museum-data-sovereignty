Human remains of three individuals and associated funerary objects were removed from locations along the west shore of Flathead Lake in Lake County, MT. Human remains of one individual were removed from within the city limits of Missoula, MT.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

This pre-contact burial was disturbed by excavation equipment and then turned over to the University of Montana, Department of Anthropology. The remains were discovered in the University\\'s collection in 2011. Of the two individuals present, one is the nearly complete skeleton of an older female, at least 50 years of age at death. The second individual, represented only by several vertebrae, was also elderly, but exact age and sex cannot be determined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1950, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a primary, flexed burial in a rock outcropping on the west shore of Flathead Lake, in Lake County, MT, during real estate development. The site is within the boundaries of the Flathead Reservation but on private land near the town of Dayton, MT. Local amateur archaeologist, Thain White, contacted Carling Malouf of the University of Montana, Department of Anthropology, and the remains and associated funerary objects were removed to the University of Montana in Missoula. The human remains and associated funerary objects were discovered in the University\\'s collection in 2011. The mostly complete skeleton is of a male, aged 35 to 50 years at death. No known individual was identified. The eight associated funerary objects are 1 large (6 cm) turtle-backed stone scraper, 1 chalcedony flake, 2 shell beads, 3 antler pieces, and 1 lot of faunal remains.\\n\\n        In 1950, during excavations for a business establishment human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed by a bulldozer from an historical Indian burial in the city of Missoula, MT. This burial site location is within the aboriginal territory of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The nearly complete skeletal remains of a child, aged 7 to 8 years at death, and associated funerary objects were transferred by the County Coroner to the University of Montana, Department of Anthropology, for analysis by Carling Malouf. In 2011, the human remains and associated funerary objects were discovered to be associated with documentation of an Indian burial. No known individual was identified.
