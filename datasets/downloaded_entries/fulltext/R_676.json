The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of this cultural item. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        The one cultural item is a doll in a wooden coffin. \\n        In or before 1903, this cultural item was collected in California by Grace Nicholson with funding from Lewis H. Farlow. The cultural item was donated to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology by Mr. Farlow in 1903. \\n        Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology records indicate that this cultural item was removed from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKlamath Indian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grave along the Klamath River, CA. Klamath Indian peoples are represented by the present-day Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon. Based on the specific cultural attribution in museum records, the probable 19th-century date of the burial, geographical location of origin within the historical territory of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon, this cultural item is considered to be affiliated with the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), this cultural item is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between this unassociated funerary object and the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this unassociated funerary object should contact Barbara Isaac, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, 11 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, telephone (617) 495-2254, before April 25, 2001. Repatriation of this unassociated funerary object to the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: March 12, 2001. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 01-7381 Filed 3-23-01; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F \\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Intent To Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA ", "agency2": "National Park Service.
