The human remains were collected during a salvage excavation at the site under the direction of Mr. Tim Nowak, Omaha District Archaeologist. The excavation was undertaken to preserve the artifacts and data eroding out of a cut-bank at the site. Human remains that were excavated from Crow Creek Site (39BF0011) are presently located at the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center (SARC), under the managerial control of the Omaha District.\\n        In 1999, SARC conducted a review of the 39BF11 collection and located human remains within the faunal collection. The five individuals consist of a child, aged 6-10, three adults of indeterminate age and sex, and one adult, possible female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The human remains were collected from the Initial Middle Missouri Component (AD 1100-1150) of the site. The human remains are determined to be Native American due to their original context in the Native American component of the site and the associated site artifacts indicating Native American ancestry. The Middle Missouri Variant, based on architectural features, geographical location, material cultural, physical anthropological (biological) data, and oral tradition, is likely to be associated with the Mandan population.
