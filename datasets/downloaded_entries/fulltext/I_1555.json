{"index": "I_1555", "messy_full": "\\n      \\n        DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR \\n        National Park Service \\n        Notice of Inventory Completion: U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, DC, and The University Museum, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR \\n        \\n          AGENCY: \\n          National Park Service, Interior. \\n        \\n        \\n          ACTION: \\n          Notice. \\n        \\n        Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, DC, and in the physical custody of The University Museum, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR. The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Gila River Indian Community near Sacaton, AZ. \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by The University Museum professional staff, on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, in consultation with representatives of the Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona. \\n        Sometime between 1931 and 1934, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from a cremation feature at an unknown site in the vicinity of Sacaton (AZ U:14), Gila River Reservation, Pinal County, AZ, by Carl Moosberg. In 1935, the human remains were donated to the Arizona State Museum by Mr. Moosberg. In 1954, the human remains were transferred to The University Museum in an exchange with the Arizona State Museum. No known individuals were identified. The two associated funerary objects are one red-on-buff jar and one Gila redware jar. \\n        Based on characteristics of the mortuary pattern and the attributes of the ceramic style, this burial has been identified as being associated with the Sedentary Phase of the Hohokam archeological tradition, which spanned the years circa A.D. 950-1150. \\n        Continuities of mortuary practices, ethnographic materials, and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman), Pee Posh (Maricopa), and Puebloan cultures. Oral traditions documented for the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico support cultural affiliation with Hohokam sites in central Arizona. Descendants of the Hohokam are members of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. \\n\\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and The University Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and The University Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the two objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and The University Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact Mary Suter, Curator of Collections, The University Museum, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, telephone (479) 575-3481, before April 30, 2008.  Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        The University Museum is responsible for notifying the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico that this notice has been published. \\n        \\n          Dated: February 28, 2008. \\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
