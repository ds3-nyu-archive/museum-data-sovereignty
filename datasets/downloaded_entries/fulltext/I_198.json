The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Historic Westville, Inc. professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Cherokee Nation; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; Poarch Band of Creek Indians (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Consulted Tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, four individuals were donated to Historic Westville, Inc. along with approximately 13,000 other Native American artifacts and reproductions. The collection was donated by Dr. Austin Flint. All attempts by the staff of Historic Westville to reach Dr. Flint or his descendants have been unsuccessful. Documentation of the donation consists of a handwritten inventory done by an appraiser preceding the donation and a signed deed of gift. The collection was re-discovered by current staff in 2016. The four individuals include one subadult of indeterminate sex based on the mandible fragment with unerupted teeth and three individuals of indeterminate age and sex. The 150 associated funerary objects are: 37 beads, 27 gorgets and possible gorgets, 34 celts and possible celts, 18 turtle and mollusk shells, 21 clay pots that may be reproductions, five flutes that are possible reproductions, five large decorated sherds, one pipe, one mask that is a possible reproduction, and one unknown ceramic.\\n        Consulting archeologists identified a percentage of the collection to aid in determining point of origin for the collection. A 5% random sampling of over 1,000 project points revealed that over 80% originated from Georgia and Tennessee.
