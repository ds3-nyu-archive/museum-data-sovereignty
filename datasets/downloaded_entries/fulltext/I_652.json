The human remains were removed from site 41HY160, San Marcos, Hays County, TX.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Texas State professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma; and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (previously listed as the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas). The following tribes were also invited to participate in consultations, but there is no record of their having responded: Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Caddo Nation of Oklahoma; Cherokee Nation; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Kialegee Tribal Town; Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Osage Nation (previously listed as the Osage Tribe); The Quapaw Tribe of Indians; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town; Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe; and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma (hereafter tribes listed in this section are referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Consulted and Invited Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Texas State professional staff also consulted with the Miakan-Garza Band of the Coahuiltecan people, a non-federally recognized Indian group.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In December 2011, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 40HY160 in Hays County, TX, following their inadvertent discovery during a construction project on the campus grounds of Texas State. A prehistoric date for the site is based on the artifacts excavated and removed from the site. At the request of Texas State University\\'s Center for Archaeological Studies, osteological analysis of the remains was performed by Drs. Kate Spradley and Michelle Hamilton of the Department of Anthropology. Additional osteological cleaning, sorting, and reconstruction assistance was provided by four graduate students (C. Figueroa-Soto, M. McClain, L. Springs, and C. Tegtmeyer). The human remains were determined to be those of a Native American adult male of prehistoric date. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.16, the Secretary of the Interior may make a recommendation for a transfer of control of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In January 2015, Texas State requested that the Secretary, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee, recommend the proposed transfer of control of the culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains in this notice to the Miakan-Garza Band of the Coahuiltecan people, a non-federally recognized Indian group. The Review Committee, acting pursuant to its responsibility under 25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(5), considered the request at its March 2015 meeting and recommended to the Secretary that the proposed transfer of control proceed.
