The Field Museum acquired these items in 1940 as the result of an exchange with the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation. The three unassociated funerary objects are two ceramic bowls and one ceramic scoop. Records indicate that the items were removed from three separate grave contexts, but the human remains are not present in Field Museum collections.\\n        Queen Creek Ruin was a large habitation site that included trash mounds, burials, pithouses, canals, adobe compounds, and a ballcourt. Architectural features, mortuary practices, ceramic types, and other items of material culture at this ruin are consistent with the Hohokam archaeological tradition and indicate occupation between approximately A.D. 950 and 1450. Continuities of mortuary practices, ethnographic material, and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman) and Puebloan cultures.\\n        On July 27, 2012, representatives of the Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona, submitted an August 2000 cultural affiliation study that addresses continuities between the Hohokam and the O\\'odham tribes. Furthermore, oral traditions that are documented for the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona support affiliation with Hohokam sites in central Arizona. The aforementioned tribes have designated the Gila River Indian Community to take the lead on repatriations from the Queen Creek Site.\\n        Determinations Made by the Field Museum\\n        Officials at the Field Museum have determined that:\\n        \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the three cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        \\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Helen Robbins, Repatriation Director, Field Museum, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605, telephone (312) 665-7317, email hrobbins@fieldmuseum.org, by July 8, 2013.
