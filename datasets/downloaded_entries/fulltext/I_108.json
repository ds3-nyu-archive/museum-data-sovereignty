The human remains were subsequently donated to the University of California by Phoebe Apperson Hearst in 1901. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Between 1897 and 1902, 24 sets of human remains were removed from San Nicolas Island, Ventura County, CA, by Mrs. Blanche Trask and subsequently donated to the museum in 1902.
