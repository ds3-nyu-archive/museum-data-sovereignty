The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        In August of 1961, Mrs. Sidney A. Peterson purchased five objects relating to the Midewiwin religion from Jack Chicag of Nett Lake, MN. The five cultural items are two beaded panels with human designs (61-1420 and 61-1419), one bear paw bag (61-1439), one cat paw bag (61-1438), and one tin can with pine residue (61-1410). \\n        Museum accession, catalogue, collector notes and purchase records, as well as consultation with representatives of the Bois Forte Band (Nett Lake) of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota, indicate that the five cultural objects are Chippewa and are from the Nett Lake Reservation, and are sacred objects. The sacred objects are derived from the Midewiwin Society, also known as the Medicine Lodge Society, and needed by Midewiwin Society members to conduct ceremonies and religious leaders of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota for the practice of traditional Native American religious ceremonies. \\n        Officials of the Science Museum of Minnesota have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C), the five cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. Officials of The Science Museum of Minnesota also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and the Bois Forte Band (Nett Lake) of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the sacred objects should contact Tilly Laskey, Curator of Ethnology, Science Museum of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55102, telephone (651) 221-9432 before April 30, 2008.  Repatriation of the sacred objects to the Bois Forte Band (Nett Lake) of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe Minnesota may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        The Science Museum of Minnesota is responsible for notifying the Bois Forte Band (Nett Lake) of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota that this notice has been published. \\n        \\n          Dated: February 18, 2008. \\n          Sherry Hutt, \\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
