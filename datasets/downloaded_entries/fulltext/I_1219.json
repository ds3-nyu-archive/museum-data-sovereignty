In October 2009, the University of Colorado Museum requested that the Review Committee recommend disposition of 235 culturally unidentifiable individuals and associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah. The Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Susanville Indian Rancheria, California; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona, wrote letters or signed the disposition agreement in support of the tribes requesting disposition. None of the Indian tribes consulted objected to the determination of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cculturally unidentifiable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d status by the University of Colorado Museum and the disposition to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah. \\n\\n        The Review Committee considered the proposal at its October 30-31, 2009, meeting and recommended disposition of the 235 culturally unidentifiable individuals and associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah. The Secretary of the Interior independently reviewed the recommendation. A May 11, 2010, letter from the Designated Federal Officer, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the University of Colorado Museum to effect disposition of the physical remains of 157 of the 235 culturally unidentifiable individuals to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, contingent on the publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. In the same letter the Secretary also recommended the transfer of the associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, to the extent allowed by Federal, state, or local law.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact Steve Lekson, Curator of Anthropology, University of Colorado Museum, in care of Jan Bernstein, NAGPRA Consultant, Bernstein & Associates, 1041 Lafayette St., Denver, CO 80218, telephone (303) 894-0648, before October 20, 2010. Disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n\\n        The University of Colorado Museum is responsible for notifying the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona;
