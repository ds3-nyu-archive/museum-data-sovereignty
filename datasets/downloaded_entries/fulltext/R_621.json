The \\ndeterminations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the \\nmuseum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these \\ncultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the \\ndeterminations within this notice.\\n    In 1926, G.C. Munro gifted 97 glass and ivory beads to the Bishop \\nMuseum. Accession records indicate that the beads were ``found some \\nyears ago with the bones of a child.\\'\\' The burial site was located on \\nthe island of L[amacr]na`i, HI. Excavation records indicate that the \\nhuman remains with whom these funerary objects were associated were not \\ncollected, or were collected but are no longer within the Bishop \\nMuseum\\'s collection.\\n    A detailed assessment of these unassociated funerary objects was \\nmade by Bishop Museum\\'s professional staff in consultation with \\nrepresentatives from the Maui/L[amacr]na`i Island Burial Council.\\n     Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Bishop \\nMuseum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these \\n97 cultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or \\nnear individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of \\nthe death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the \\nevidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native \\nAmerican individual. Officials of the Bishop Museum also have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these 97 \\nunassociated funerary objects and the Maui/L[amacr]na`i Island Burial \\nCouncil, Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai`i Nei, and the Office of \\nHawaiian Affairs.\\n     This notice has been sent to officials of the Maui/L[amacr]na`i \\nIsland Burial Council, Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai`i Nei, and Office \\nof Hawaiian Affairs. Representatives of any other Native Hawaiian \\norganization that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with \\nthese unassociated funerary objects should contact Dr. Guy Kaulukukui, \\nVice President of Cultural Studies, Bishop Museum, 1525 Bernice Street, \\nHonolulu, Hawaii, 96718-2704, telephone (808) 848-4126 before November \\n12, 2002. Repatriation of these unassociated funerary objects to the \\nMaui/L[amacr]na`i Island Burial Council, Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O \\nHawai`i Nei and Office of Hawaiian Affairs may begin after that date if \\nno additional claimants come forward.\\n\\n    Dated: August 28, 2002.\\nRobert Stearns,\\nManager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n[FR Doc. 02-25874 Filed 10-9-02; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-S\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
