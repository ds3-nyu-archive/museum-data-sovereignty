No known individuals were identified The 202 \\nassociated funerary objects include points, drills, awls, scrapers, \\nground stone artifacts, non-human bone artifacts, shell artifacts, \\nbasketry fragments, red ochre, clay figurine fragments, and copper. In \\n1995, this individual and associated funerary objects were retrieved by \\nBureau of Land Management professional staff from Dr. Bonnichsen.\\n    This individual has been identified as Native American based on the \\npresence and type of associated funerary objects. Historic and \\nethnographic evidence indicates only Paiute and Shoshone tribes have \\noccupied this area in historic times, and no non-Paiute/Shoshone pre-\\ncontact cultures have been identified within this area of southwestern \\nIdaho.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Bureau \\nof Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof one individual of Native American ancestry.

Lastly, officials \\nof the Bureau of Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 25 \\nU.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains \\nand associated funerary objects and the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the \\nDuck Valley Reservation, Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall \\nReservation, and the Northwestern Band of Shoshoni Indians of Utah.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Shoshone-Paiute \\nTribes of the Duck Valley Reservation, Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the \\nFort Hall Reservation, and the Northwestern Band of Shoshoni Indians of \\nUtah.
