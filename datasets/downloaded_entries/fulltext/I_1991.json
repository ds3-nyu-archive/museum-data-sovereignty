In 2000, one ceramic sherd associated with the burials from the Leary site was discovered at the Nebraska State Historical Society in a box that had been mislabeled.  As a result of this discovery, the number of associated funerary objects from the Leary site is corrected by substituting \\xe2\\x80\\x9c302 associated funerary objects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for \\xe2\\x80\\x9c301 associated funerary objects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the fifth paragraph of the 1997 notice and by substituting \\xe2\\x80\\x9c343 objects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for \\xe2\\x80\\x9c342 objects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the seventh paragraph of the 1997 notice.\\n        \\n          Dated: August 6, 2001.\\n          John Robbins,\\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 01-25155 Filed 10-5-01; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-S\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Correction--Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Lincoln, NE", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.", "action": "Notice.", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Dated: August 6, 2001.", "signature_name": "John Robbins,", "signature_title": "Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships.", "fr_doc": "[FR Doc. 01-25155 Filed 10-5-01; 8:45 am]", "billing_code": "BILLING CODE 4310-70-S", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
