The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the Superintendent, Gulf Islands National Seashore.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        Between 1964 and 1965, three cultural items were removed from Naval Live Oaks Reservation in Santa Rosa County, FL. These cultural items were associated with three burials. According to the excavation report one set of remains was re-interred. Given the reported conditions of the remains in the other two burials, it is likely that they were left in-situ or re-interred, but neither can be confirmed. At the time of the excavation, the Naval Live Oaks Reservation Cemetery was under the jurisdiction of the State of Florida. In 1971, the site became part of Gulf Islands National Seashore. The objects appear to have been curated at the Fort Walton Temple Mound Museum until 1981, when they were donated to Gulf Islands National Seashore by curator Yulee Lazarus. The objects are currently curated at the National Park Service\\'s Southeast Archeological Center. The three unassociated funerary objects are one pig bone, one iron fragment, and one shell fragment.\\n        Analysis of ceramic vessel fragments indicates that the Naval Live Oaks Reservation Cemetery site was in use during the Bear Point phase of the Pensacola period (A.D. 1500 to 1700). Historical documentation places the Pensacola Indians in the area of the Naval Live Oak Reservation Cemetery site during that time period. The Pensacola culture extended along the western Gulf coast of Florida, but also shared ceramic styles with groups in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Conflict in the 18th century displaced the Pensacola people in Florida, and historical evidence indicates that some were assimilated into the Choctaw. Others were likely absorbed by the Creek Indians when they overtook the area. Pensacola people are also believed to have gone west with other area tribes to join the Tunica-Biloxi Indians. The Pensacola spoke a Muscogean language; other Muscogee language family speakers include the Alabama, Seminole, Miccosukee, and Coushatta.\\n        Determinations Made by Gulf Islands National Seashore\\n        Officials of Gulf Islands National Seashore have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the three cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians; Kialegee Tribal Town; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town; and Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Daniel R.
