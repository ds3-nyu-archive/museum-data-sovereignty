John W. Chapman from AK, Yukon-Koyukuk Borough, \\nAnvik Village, and donated to the Museum. No known individuals were \\nidentified. The 45 associated funerary objects include 11 pottery \\ndishes; a baleen comb; a tobacco box; three wooden boxes; three metal \\nknives; two knife handles; four implements; two handles; a graver\\'s \\ntool; six bone tubes; two bone needles; an ivory point; a scraper; two \\nbear tooth pendants; a flint chip; and four metal bracelets.\\n    These individuals have been identified as Native American based on \\nburial practices and types of associated funerary objects. Geographic \\nlocation is consistent with the post-contact territory of the Ingalik \\n(an Athabascan group). The Ingalik have occupied Anvik Village since \\n1887 and for an undetermined period prior to that date. Some, perhaps \\nall, of the graves date to the post-contact period. Burial practices \\nare consistent with interior Athabascan and Ingalik funerary practices. \\nAssociated funerary objects are consistent with Ingalik culture. Museum \\ncatalog information describes the remains as Athabascan.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the American \\nMuseum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof a minimum of seven individuals of Native American ancestry. \\nOfficials of the American Museum of Natural History have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the 45 objects listed \\nabove are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near \\nindividual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the \\ndeath rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the American Museum of \\nNatural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), \\nthere is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects and Anvik Village.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of Anvik Village, Ingalik \\nInc., and Doyon, Ltd. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Martha Graham, Registrar \\nfor Cultural Resources, Department of Anthropology, American Museum of \\nNatural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, New York, NY 10024-\\n5192; telephone: (212) 769-5846 before July 12, 1999. Repatriation of \\nthe human remains and associated funerary objects to Anvik Village may \\nbegin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: June 1, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
