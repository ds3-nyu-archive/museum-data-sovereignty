These human remains and associated funerary objects were \\ndonated to the Neville Public Museum by H.L. Ward, Payson Williams, and \\nMrs. E.O. Paulson the same year. No known individuals were identified. \\nThe 487 associated funerary objects include ceramics, bark and wood \\nfragments, turtle carapace fragments, mammal, fish, and bird bones, a \\nturtle net-spreader, shell, brass and/or copper beads, a gun flint, \\nbrass or copper bracelets, shell gorget fragment, and an antler flaker.\\n    These individual have been identified as Native American based on \\nthe associated funerary objects and apparent age of the burials. The \\npresence of Oneota-style vessels and Allamakee Trailed sherds, as well \\nas a gun flint indicate a late precontact to early historic period date \\nof internment for these individuals. The Ioway peoples have been \\nculturally affiliated with the Oneota based on continuties of material \\nculture, and historical documents. Historical documents, archeological \\nevidence, and ethnohistoric evidence indicate a continual Ho-Chunk \\n(Winnebago) presence on the east side of Green Bay from precontact \\nperiod into the historic period. Oral history evidence presented by \\nrepresentatives of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, the Iowa Tribe of \\nKansas, the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska \\nfurther indicate Oneota affilation in this area of Brown County with \\nthese present day tribes.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Neville \\nPublic Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the \\nhuman remains listed above represent the physical remains of seven \\nindividuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Neville \\nPublic Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 \\n(3)(A), the 487 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have \\nbeen placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death \\nor later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of \\nthe Neville Public Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \\n3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects and the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, the \\nIowa Tribe of Kansas, the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Winnebago \\nTribe of Nebraska.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Ho-Chunk Nation of \\nWisconsin, the Iowa Tribe of Kansas, the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and \\nthe Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Representatives of any other Indian \\ntribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects should contact Ann Koski, \\nDirector, Neville Public Museum of Brown County, 210 Museum Place, \\nGreen Bay, WI 54303; telephone: (414) 448-4460, before June 23, 1997. \\nRepatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to \\nthe Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma may begin after that date if no additional \\nclaimants come forward.\\nDated: May 16, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
