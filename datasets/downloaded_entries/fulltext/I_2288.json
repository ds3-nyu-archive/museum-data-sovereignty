No known \\nindividual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    Correspondence from the donor indicates these human remains were \\n``exhumed from a grave in an old burying ground of the Pequot \\nIndians.\\'\\' Although Peabody Museum documentation lists the geographic \\nlocation of the human remains as ``Westerly, Rhode Island\\'\\' due to the \\npostmark on the collector\\'s correspondence, there is no information \\nthat the remains actually came from that location. Based on the copper \\nstaining on the human remains, these human remains have been determined \\nto date to the contact/early historic period (post-1614). Consultation \\nevidence presented by representatives of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe \\nindicates that in about 1870, the Fanning Road cemetery in Ledyard CT, \\na known historic burial area of the Mashantucket Pequot was looted. The \\ncultural attribution of the burial area given by the donor, combined \\nwith the historic date of the human remains, the donation date of the \\nhuman remains, and the date of looting of the historic Fanning Road \\nburial area of the Mashantucket Pequot indicates that these human \\nremains most likely came from the Fanning Road cemetery.\\n    In 1923, human remains representing two individuals from \\nStonington, CT were donated to the Peabody Museum from Brown \\nUniversity, RI. No known individuals were identified. No associated \\nfunerary objects are present.\\n    Museum documentation indicates these human remains were collected \\non an unknown date by Reverend Frederick Denison. In 1871, Denison \\ndonated his collection of Native American cultural material to the \\nJenks Museum at Brown University. Museum records and copper staining on \\nthe human remains indicate the remains were interred sometime during \\nthe early historic period or later (post-1614 A.D.). Oral tradition and \\nhistoric documentation support that the geographic area of Stonington \\nis within\\n\\n[[Page 32254]]\\n\\nthe aboriginal and historic homeland of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe.\\n    In 1937, human remains representing one individual from Ecclestone \\nSite, Mystic, CT were donated to the Peabody Museum from the Department \\nof Archaeology at Philips Andover Academy in Andover, MA. No known \\nindividuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are \\npresent.\\n    These human remains were collected in 1922 as part of an expedition \\nby Warren King Moorehead. Museum documentation indicates that Moorehead \\nwas specifically investigating Native American burial grounds on this \\nexpedition. Museum records indicate the individual was interred \\nsometime during the contact/early historic period (post-1614 A.D.). \\nOral tradition and historic documentation supports the Ecclestone site \\nas being within the aboriginal and historic homelands of the \\nMashantucket Pequot Indians.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Peabody \\nMuseum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the \\nphysical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry. \\nOfficials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nNative American human remains and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe.\\n    In 1937, human remains representing one individual from Norwich, CT \\nwere donated to the Peabody Museum from the Department of Archaeology \\nat Philips Andover Academy, Andover, MA. No known individual was \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    These human remains were collected in 1922 as part of an expedition \\nby Warren King Moorehead. Museum documentation indicates Moorehead was \\nspecifically investigating Native American burial grounds on this \\nexpedition. Museum records indicate this individual was interred \\nsometime during the contact/early historic period (post-1614 A.D.). \\nOral tradition and historic documentation support the conclusion that \\nthe geographic area of Norwich falls within the aboriginal and historic \\nhomelands of the Mohegan Indian Tribe.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Peabody \\nMuseum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the \\nphysical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. \\nOfficials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nNative American human remains and the Mohegan Indian Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Mashantucket Pequot \\nTribe and the Mohegan Indian Tribe. Representatives of any other Indian \\ntribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects should contact Barbara Isaac, \\nRepatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, \\nHarvard University, 11 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138; telephone: \\n(617) 495-2254, before July 16, 1999. Repatriation of the human remains \\nto the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and the Mohegan Indian Tribe may begin \\nafter that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n    The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations \\nwithin this notice.\\nDated: June 10, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
