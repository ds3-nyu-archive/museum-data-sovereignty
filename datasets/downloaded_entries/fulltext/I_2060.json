The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma; Comanche Indian Tribe, Oklahoma; Crow Tribe of Montana; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; \\n        Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Kaw Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, \\n\\n        Montana; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Osage Tribe, Oklahoma; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians, Kansas; Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; Sac & Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Sac & Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, Oklahoma. \\n        In 1915, human remains consisting of a single tooth representing one individual were donated to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology by Dr. N.L. Roberts. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum records indicate that these human remains were collected by Dr. Roberts from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKaw Village\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the mouth of the Blue Earth River, Pottawatomie County, KS, sometime prior to 1914. The remains were transferred to Frederick H. Sterns of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology during his excavations of the site in 1914 and were accessioned into the museum in 1915. \\n        The site from which these remains originated was known at the time of Sterns\\' excavations as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKaw Village,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and today is known as the Blue Earth Village site. It has been identified in historical documents as the village occupied by the Kansa between 1757 and 1825. Archeological evidence also supports an occupation of the site between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Based on archeological and historical evidence, it is likely that these remains are those of an individual of the Kansa Tribe. The Kansa, or Kaw, are represented by the present-day Kaw Nation, Oklahoma. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Kaw Nation, Oklahoma. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma; Comanche Indian Tribe, Oklahoma; Crow Tribe of Montana; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Kaw Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Osage Tribe, Oklahoma; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians, Kansas; Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; Sac & Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Sac & Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Barbara Isaac, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, 11 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, telephone (617) 495-2254, before May 14, 2001. Repatriation of the human remains to the Kaw Nation, Oklahoma may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: March 27, 2001. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 01-8983 Filed 4-11-01; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA ", "agency2": " National Park Service, Interior.
