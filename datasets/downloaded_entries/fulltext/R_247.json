The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item(s) \\n        At an unknown date, one unassociated funerary object was removed from a mound at an unknown location in Kentucky and acquired by the Grand Rapids Public Museum from a source with the initials \\xe2\\x80\\x9cK.S.I.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (likely Kent Scientific Institute, the former name of the Grand Rapids Public Museum). The object is a stone human effigy vessel that was identified in the museum records as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]aterbottle of sundried (probably Peruvian Indian make) clay for burial with dead S (W?), KY.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Digital images of the object were reviewed by the Chickasaw Nation Preservation and Repatriation Department and a professor at Murray State University. It was determined that this vessel was identical to a human effigy vessel from Wickcliffe Mounds, KY, and likely affiliated with the Chickasaw Nation. In the Great Chickasaw Cession of 1818, lands were ceded in western Kentucky to the U.S. Government and traditional tribal hunting and trading routes covered a large portion of Kentucky. Therefore, it is conceivable that this stone human effigy vessel is culturally affiliated with the Chickasaw Nation. \\n        In May and November of 1912, one lot of unassociated funerary objects was removed from an unknown location near Tupelo in Lee County, MS, by W. C. Wyman. At an unknown date, the lot of unassociated funerary objects was sold to Dr. Ruth Herrick by an unknown person. In 1974, the lot of unassociated funerary objects was bequeathed to the Grand Rapids Public Museum by Dr. Ruth Herrick. The lot of unassociated funerary objects is identified in the Grand Rapids Public Museum\\'s records as \\xe2\\x80\\x9clarge beads, glass, shell, and bone, early trade beads.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Digital images of these objects were reviewed by the Chickasaw Nation Preservation and Repatriation Department, who determined that these objects are likely affiliated with the Chickasaw Nation. \\n        At an unknown date, 1 lot of unassociated funerary objects was removed from an unknown location near Tupelo in Lee County, MS, by an unknown individual. At an unknown date, the lot of unassociated funerary objects was acquired by Dr. Ruth Herrick. In 1974, the lot of associated funerary objects was bequeathed to the Grand Rapids Public Museum by Dr. Ruth Herrick. The lot of unassociated funerary objects is identified in the Grand Rapids Public Museum\\'s records as \\xe2\\x80\\x9canimal bone and shell beads, identified by donor and G. Olson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Digital images of these objects were reviewed by the Chickasaw Nation Preservation and Repatriation Department, who determined that these objects are likely affiliated with the Chickasaw Nation. Documented evidence of Chickasaw occupation in northern Mississippi supports cultural affiliation of the two lots of unassociated funerary objects from Lee County, MS, with the Chickasaw Nation. \\n        Determinations Made by the Grand Rapids Public Museum \\n        Officials of the Grand Rapids Public Museum have determined that: \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 3 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual. \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Chickasaw Nation. \\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary objects should contact Marilyn Merdzinski, Director of Education & Interpretation, Grand Rapids Public Museum, 272 Pearl St. NW., Grand Rapids, MI 49501, telephone (616) 929-1801 March 21, 2013.
