The human remains were removed from Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, Long Island, NY.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d).

In 1926, the town of Southampton donated the human remains, which consist of the cranial fragments of one adult, to the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. They were accessioned into the collection of the Department of Physical Anthropology of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation that same year. In 1956, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Theodore Kazamiroff, NYU College of Dentistry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The age of the human remains cannot be determined from the available information. Forensic examination revealed diagnostic features of an individual with Native American ancestry. Without any information about the site or age of the remains, no identifiable earlier group can be determined.\\n        Shinnecock Hills, which lies near the northeastern end of Long Island, is not included in any treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders that establish aboriginal land. The area is, however, within territory that was long recognized by the tribe, the town of Southampton, and the state of New York as Shinnecock land. In 1703, the Shinnecock and town of Southampton reached an agreement in which the Shinnecock held a 1,000 year lease of approximately 3,500 acres, including Shinnecock Hills. The area was subsequently referred to as the Shinnecock Reservation in various state and local documents. The Shinnecock renegotiated their lease in 1859 and relinquished the lands at Shinnecock Hills in exchange for fee title to the land at Shinnecock Neck. The current Shinnecock Reservation, which no longer includes Shinnecock Hills, was placed into trust after the tribe was federally recognized in 2010. The Department of Interior proposed finding on the Shinnecock petition for federal recognition identifies Shinnecock Hills as part of the pre-1859 Shinnecock Reservation.\\n        Determinations Made by the NYU College of Dentistry\\n        Officials of the NYU College of Dentistry have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on diagnostic cranial features observed during forensic examination.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian Tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Authoritative governmental documents, including the Shinnecock Indian Nation\\'s federal recognition decision, state agreements, and local property records indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Shinnecock Indian Nation.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Shinnecock Indian Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Louis Terracio, NYU College of Dentistry, 345 East 24th Street, New York, NY 10010, telephone (212) 998-9717, email louis.terracio@nyu.edu, by September 7, 2018.
