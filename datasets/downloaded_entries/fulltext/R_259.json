Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution. The Elden Pueblo (site NA 142) is on the Coconino National Forest. These three objects have been curated at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, CA, since 1931, when the Smithsonian Institution transferred the objects to the musem. The three unassociated funerary objects are two ceramic bowls and one ceramic jar.\\n        Based on archaeological evidence and material culture, Elden Pueblo (site NA 142) has been identified as a Northern Sinagua site, comprised of a pueblo, pithouses, and outlier pueblos, which were occupied in the second half of the 13th and the first quarter of the 14th centuries A.D. The records at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and the Smithsonian Institution indicate that these three cultural items were removed from a burial context and that the human remains were either left in the ground or are not locatable at the present time. Continuities among the ethnographic materials in the Flagstaff area of north central Arizona indicate that the Northern Sinagua sites in that area are affiliated with the Hopi Tribe, Arizona. In addition, oral traditions presented by representatives of the Hopi Tribe support their claims of cultural affiliation with Northern Sinagua sites in this portion of north central Arizona.\\n        Determinations Made by the USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region\\n        Officials of the USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region and the Coconino National Forest have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the three cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Hopi Tribe, Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary objects should contact Dr. Frank E.
