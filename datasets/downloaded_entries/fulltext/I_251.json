Weedon, who was a medical doctor under contract to the Army, treated Osceola during his captivity at Ft. Marion and later at Ft. Moultrie (1837-1838). Before he died, Osceola had given a few personal effects to Dr. Weedon, but the braided lock of hair is presumed to have been taken after death. Osceola\\'s postcranial remains were buried at Ft. Moultrie in 1838; however, his head was retained by Dr. Weedon. It is believed that, later, the head was housed at the Surgical and Pathological Museum in New York City, and was lost in the fire that destroyed the museum in 1866.\\n        A lock of Osceola\\'s hair remained with the Weedon family from 1838 until its donation to the Florida Department of State in 1989. Taking a lock of a descendant\\'s hair for a keepsake was a popular western custom in the 1800s. The hair is in a braided plait that is 53/4\\xe2\\x80\\xb3 long, and consists of approximately seven strands of hair.
