The human remains were removed from the area of Omaha, NE.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Field Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Prairie Island Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Santee Sioux Nation, Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota; Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota; Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.\\n        In 1893, the Field Museum of Natural History purchased the skull of one individual from Ward\\'s Natural Science Establishment of Rochester, NY (Field Museum of Natural History catalogue number 41882). Original Field Museum of Natural History records state that the human remains are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSioux, killed 1861 (Omaha).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains have been identified as Native American based on the specific cultural and geographic attribution in Field Museum of Natural History records. The records identify the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSioux\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Omaha, NE. While the Santee Sioux Nation is the only Federally-recognized Sioux Indian tribe in Nebraska at the present time, the 1861 date of death predates the establishment of the Santee Sioux Reservation in Nebraska.

Officials of the Field Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Prairie Island Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Santee Sioux Nation, Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota; Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota; Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota; Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.\\n\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Helen Robbins, Director of Repatriation, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605-2496, telephone (312) 665-7317, before July 17, 2008.
