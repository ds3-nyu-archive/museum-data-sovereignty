The human remains recovered with these cultural items have previously been repatriated from the University of Pennsylvania Museum. \\n        The two cultural items consist of a bone eye and a slate point. \\n        In 1932, these two cultural items were recovered with a burial on Yukon Island, Alaska during excavations conducted under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum by Frederica de Laguna. The human remains recovered with these cultural items have previously been repatriated from the University of Pennsylvania Museum. \\n        In 1953, the four cultural items mentioned above were sent to the University of Alaska Museum from the University of Pennsylvania Museum as part of an exchange collection. \\n        Based on material culture and oral history, the sites listed above have been identified as Kachemak Bay period occupations (c. 1500 AD). \\n        Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these four cultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual. Officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the Chugach Alaska Corporation. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Chugach Alaska Corporation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these objects should contact Deb Corbett, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1011 E. Tudor Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99503; telephone: (907) 786-3399, fax: (907) 786-3635 before May 1, 2000. Repatriation of these objects to the Chugach Alaska Corporation may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: March 23, 2000. \\n          Francis P.
