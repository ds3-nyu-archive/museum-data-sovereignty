Remnants of a leather loop are present on the lid. The diamond design on the treasure basket has been identified as a snake design that represents the gopher or king snake.\\n        Between 1951 and 1952, a basket in the collection of Mrs. Charles S.

The decoration features two bands of three coils each in dark brown around the shoulder. The rest of the basket is a variegated natural fiber color. Parts of three coils approximately 3.0 cm from the base are broken but have been stabilized. The basket was identified as a Ceremonial Cooking basket used on such occasions as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpring Ceremony\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the preparation of acorn.
