Details regarding these excavations and sites may be found in a report, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn Archaeological Survey of Guntersville Basin on the Tennessee River in Northern Alabama,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by William S. Webb and Charles G. Wilder. The human remains and associated funerary objects excavated from the sites listed in this notice have been in the physical custody of the AMNH at the University of Alabama since excavation, but are under the control of TVA.\\n        From March to April of 1938, human remains representing, at minimum, 37 individuals were removed from the Hardin site (1JA27) in Jackson County, AL, after TVA acquired the site on October 16, 1936. Excavations revealed two occupations, including Late Woodland Flint River phase (A.D. 500-1000) and Mississippian Henry Island phase (A.D. 1200-1450). The human remains include adults, juveniles, and infants of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        From January to June of 1938, human remains representing, at minimum, 158 individuals were removed from the Saulty and Riley site (1JA28) in Jackson County, AL, after TVA purchased the site on October 16, 1936. Site 1JA28 was composed of both a village and adjacent mound, with Woodland (Flint River phase) and Mississippian (Henry Island phase) occupations identified. The human remains include adults, juveniles and children of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. The 4,711 associated funerary objects include 1 stone adze; 1 biface fragment; 17 bone awls; 1 bone fish hook; 1 stone celt; 2 Little Bear Creek projectile points; 1non-cortical flake; 2 unidentified projectile points; 4,680 shell beads; 3 shell gorgets/pendants; 1 stone discoidal; and 1 turtle shell net gage.\\n        From September of 1938 to January of 1939, human remains representing, at minimum, 84 individuals were removed from the Laws site (1MS100) on Pine Island in Marshall County, AL, after TVA purchased the land on April 21, 1937. Excavations began at the levee adjacent to the river and proceeded by both vertical slicing and horizontal excavations. There appear to have been at least four occupations at this site, including a pre-ceramic period with steatite vessels; a village using limestone-tempered pottery during the Flint River phase (A.D. 500-1000); a late Mississippian occupation using shell-tempered ceramics and rectilinear wall trench structures (Crow Creek phase, A.D. 1500-1700); and burials with Euro-American trade goods circa A.D. 1670-1715. The human remains include adults, juveniles and infants of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. The 249 associated funerary objects include 1 bone awl; 1 canine bone; 2 pieces of fired clay; 1 graphite nodule; 1 modified bone; 241 shell beads; 1 shell ear plug; and 1 shell pendant.\\n        From October to November of 1937, human remains representing, at minimum, 11 individuals were removed from site 1MS121 on Pine Island in Marshall County, AL, after TVA purchased the site on April 19, 1937. There were excavations in both the village and adjacent mound. There are no radiocarbon dates for this site. Artifacts recovered from the site indicate both a Woodland and Mississippian occupation. The human remains include adults, juveniles and infants of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At the time of the excavation and removal of these human remains and associated funerary objects, the land from which the human remains and associated funerary objects were removed was not the tribal land of any federally recognized Indian tribe. On May 2, 2017, TVA consulted with all federally recognized Indian tribes who are recognized as aboriginal to the area from which these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed. These tribes are the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. None of these Indian tribes agreed to accept control of the human remains and associated funerary objects. After further consultation, TVA has decided to transfer control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; and The Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Determinations Made by the Tennessee Valley Authority\\n        Officials of TVA have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on their presence in prehistoric archeological sites and osteological analysis.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 290 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 4,960 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian Tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1)(i), at the time of excavation of the human remains and associated funerary objects, the land from which the cultural items were removed was not the tribal land of any federally recognized Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1)(ii), the following tribes are aboriginal to the area from which the cultural items were excavated: The Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.
