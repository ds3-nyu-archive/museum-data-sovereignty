In 1996, the Putnam Museum of History and Natural Science transferred its Crawford Farm collection to the Illinois State Museum in Springfield (Accession 1996-105). This collection includes artifacts, shells, and animal bones from 34 pit features. In 2013, the Illinois State Museum loaned part of its Crawford Farm collection to the Illinois State Archeological Survey in Champaign-Urbana for an analysis of animal remains.

The presence of horse remains in Pit 10 affirms that the human remains found in this feature were associated with the historic Saukenuk village occupation at the site. The human remains are likely Native American because they were associated with a village occupied by as many as 100 lodges of Sauk Indians in the early nineteenth century. Historical records linking Saukenuk village with the Sauk Indian tribe include maps and reports prepared by American explorers and Indian agents.
