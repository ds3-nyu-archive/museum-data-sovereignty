The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon; the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon (previously listed as the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Reservation); Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, Oregon; the Coquille Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Coquille Tribe of Oregon); Elk Valley Rancheria, California; and the Tolowa Dee-ni\\' Nation (previously listed as the Smith River Rancheria, California).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1961, human remains representing, at minimum, 15 individuals were removed from the Pistol River site, 35CU61, in Curry County, OR, a location of the aboriginal village site of Chetlessentun, during legally authorized excavations by archeologists from the University of Oregon. No known individuals were identified. The 21 associated funerary objects include three projectile points, four projectile point fragments, one drill fragment, one worked flake, one worked bone, one worked tine, one spoon bowl, 2 glass beads, one piece of glass, one piece of wood, and 5 chipped stone flakes.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Raymonds Dune site, 35CU62, about 0.4 km north of Chetlessentun, in Curry County, OR, by a private individual. The human remains were donated to the Museum and accessioned in 1947. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In 1942, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual, were removed by the private individual referenced above from a location described in donor records as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPistol River Dune,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9con the slope 75\\xe2\\x80\\xb2 to 100\\xe2\\x80\\xb2 east of the central group of shell heaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No further information is present.
