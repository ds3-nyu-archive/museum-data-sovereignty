The human remains were stored at the Kodiak Area Native Association\\'s Alutiiq Culture Center and, in 1995, the remains were transferred to the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository. The human remains consist of a humerus bone (accession # AM115). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        The Blisky site is a prehistoric settlement on Near Island, one of a cluster of small islands that form the northeastern entrance to Chiniak Bay on northern Kodiak Island. The human remains came from midden deposits, most likely associated with the Koniag or Kachemak tradition. Many archeologists believe that the people of the Kachemak tradition are ancestral to the people of the Koniag tradition, who are in turn ancestral to contemporary Alutiiq people. Specifically, the human remains were removed from an area traditionally used by the Tangirnaq Native Village (formerly Lesnoi Village (aka Woody Island)) and the Sun\\'aq Tribe of Kodiak (previously listed as the Shoonaq\\' Tribe of Kodiak) people.\\n        Determinations Made By the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository and the University of Alaska Museum of the North\\n        Officials of the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository and the University of Alaska Museum of the North have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Tangirnaq Native Village (formerly Lesnoi Village (aka Woody Island)) and the Sun\\'aq Tribe of Kodiak (previously listed as the Shoonaq\\' Tribe of Kodiak).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Alisha Drabek, Executive Director, Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository, 215 Mission Road, Suite 101, Kodiak, AK 99615, telephone (907) 486-7004, by July 24, 2014.
