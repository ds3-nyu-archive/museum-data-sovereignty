Moosberg in 1935. In 1953, the vessel and the remains were sent to the Chicago Natural History Museum (now the Field Museum of Natural History) as part of an exchange. In December 2005, the Field Museum returned the vessel and the remains to the Arizona State Museum. Additional human remains from the same site, representing a minimum of one individual, were reported in a Notice of Inventory Completion published in the Federal Register on December 22, 2004 (FR Doc. 04-28000, page 76781).\\n        Based on characteristics of the mortuary pattern and the attributes of the ceramic style, this burial has been identified as being associated with the Sedentary phase of the Hohokam archeological tradition, which spanned the years circa A.D. 950-1150.\\n        Continuities of mortuary practices, ethnographic materials, and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman), Pee Posh (Maricopa), and Puebloan cultures.
