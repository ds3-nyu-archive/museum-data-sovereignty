The remains were collected by the Pima County Sheriff\\'s Department and assigned a case number. The medical examiner determined that the human remains were prehistoric and likely Native American.

The legally authorized excavation was conducted by ASM under the direction of James Ayres and Walter Birkby. The collection was brought to ASM but no accession number was assigned.
