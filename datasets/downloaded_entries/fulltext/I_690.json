These remains were donated to Gulf Islands National Seashore at an unknown date by Yulee Lazarus of the Fort Walton Temple Mound Museum. No known individuals were identified. The nine associated funerary objects are three untyped vessel fragments, two Weeden Island Incised vessel fragments, and four Wakulla Check Stamped vessel fragments.\\n        Top of Benchmark 2 is a prehistoric midden site that dates from the Weeden Island to the Pensacola period (400 B.C.-A.D. 1700) and was first reported by William Lazarus and Gordon Simmons in the 1960s. Based on diagnostic ceramics, the Pensacola people were most likely the inhabitants of the area during this time. The Pensacola culture extended along the western Gulf coast of Florida, but also shared ceramic styles with groups in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Conflict in the 18th century displaced the Pensacola people in Florida, and historical evidence indicates that some were assimilated into the Choctaw. Others were likely absorbed by the Creek Indians when they overtook the area. Pensacola people are also believed to have gone west with other area tribes to join the Tunica-Biloxi Indians.
