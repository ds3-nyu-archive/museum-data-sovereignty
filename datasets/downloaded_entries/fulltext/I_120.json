The human remains were excavated by Ernest Volk as part of Volk\\'s work for the World\\'s Columbian Exposition. The Field Museum acquired the human remains in October 1893. The individuals removed from Trench 11, Grave 6 include an adult of unknown sex represented by partial cranial and post-cranial elements, as well as one adult of unknown sex represented by fragmentary cranial remains, found together with an individual of unknown age or sex represented only by a temporal bone. No known individuals were identified. The five associated funerary objects, found in Trench 11, Grave 6 are one non-diagnostic pot sherd and four culturally unmodified objects.\\n        The site where these three individuals were found lies adjacent to a later excavation performed by Dorothy Cross. Volk\\'s original excavation notes and the diagnostic stratigraphy of the site produced by Cross allowed for the dating of these individuals to the Late Woodland or historic period. These human remains were determined to be Native American based on their archeological context and collection history.
