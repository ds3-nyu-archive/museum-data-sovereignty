The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Klamath County, OR.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects was made by University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alturas Indian Rancheria, California; Klamath Tribes; Pit River Tribe, California (includes XL Ranch, Big Ben, Likely, Lookout, Montgomery Creek and Roaring Creek Rancherias); Round Valley Indian Tribes, Round Valley Reservation, California (previously listed as the Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation, California); Susanville Indian Rancheria, California; and The Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1962, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from Big Boulder Village, site 35KL18, Klamath County, OR, during legally authorized excavations conducted by University of Oregon archeologists. The human remains were subsequently transferred to the museum (Acc. #230) and consist of three adults of indeterminate sex (Cat. #11-525). No known individuals were identified. The nine associated funerary objects are three worked flakes, three obsidian fragments, one lot of fiber pieces, one scraper, and one projectile point.\\n        According to written materials on excavations at Big Boulder Village, the historic range places the site in Klamath-Modoc territory, while artifact and feature comparisons suggest either Modoc or Achumawi affiliation. All burials precede house construction and may date to early prehistoric times (5800 B.C. to 2800 B.C.). Historical documents, ethnographic sources, and oral history indicate that the Klamath, Modoc, and Achumawi peoples have occupied this area of south-central Oregon and north-central California. The human remains are determined to be Native American based on archeological context and are reasonably believed to be Modoc or Achumawi. The Modoc, and Achumawi are represented today by the Alturas Indian Rancheria, California; Klamath Tribes; Pit River Tribe, California (includes XL Ranch, Big Ben, Likely, Lookout, Montgomery Creek and Roaring Creek Rancherias); Round Valley Indian Tribes, Round Valley Reservation, California (previously listed as the Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation, California); Susanville Indian Rancheria, California; and The Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History\\n        Officials of the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the nine objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Pamela Endzweig, Director of Collections, University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History, 1224 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1224, telephone (541) 346-5120, email endzweig@uoregon.edu, by December 27, 2019.
