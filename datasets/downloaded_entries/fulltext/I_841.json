The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Texas A&M University (TAMU) professional staff in 1995, and the remains were determined to be ancestral to the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona.

The human remains were determined to be one individual of indeterminate age and sex (TAMU NAGPRA 73). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The diagnostic artifacts recovered in the same strata and area indicate that these human remains were early prehistoric, possibly Paleoinidian.\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Sulphur Springs site (AZ FF:10:14) in Cochise County, AZ, by Dr. Michael Waters of TAMU.

The diagnostic artifacts recovered from the same site indicate that these remains date to the late Paleoindian or early Archaic period.\\n        Based on the geographic location of these sites, TAMU staff found it reasonable to trace a relationship of shared group identity between the human remains in this notice and the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona.\\n        Determinations Made by Texas A&M University\\n        Officials of Texas A&M University have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Suzanne L.
