The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation. The following additional tribes were contacted but did not participate in the consultation and deferred to the Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation: Nooksack Indian Tribe and Upper Skagit Indian Tribe.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        On May 13, 1999, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a recorded site in Whatcom County, WA. During the monitoring of an expansion of the parking lot inside Birch Bay State Park boundaries, fragments of bone were inadvertently discovered. At the time, these fragments were believed to be faunal. The fragments were subsequently delivered to Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission headquarters and stored in collections. In 2001, the fragments were reviewed by an anthropologist and were determined to be human remains and to be consistent with an extended postmortem interval, but no cultural, gender, or age specific characteristics could be determined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The site is a known prehistoric archaeological site that consists of material from Native American permanent and seasonal villages, occupied predominantly by the Semiahmoo, Lummi, and Nooksack people until the time of European settlement in the 1870s. The age of the site is dated to a minimum of 2,000 years ago and numerous burials have been excavated from within and below a shell midden on this site. Because of the location from which the human remains were removed and the condition of the human remains, Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission staff has determined that the human remains are of Native American descent. A representative from the Lummi Tribe, in consultation, confirmed the Lummi people occupied and utilized the area of Birch Bay.
