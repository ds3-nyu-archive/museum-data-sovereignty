No known individuals were identified. The 62 associated \\nfunerary objects include non-human bone, beads, a mirror, and a ceramic \\nplate.\\n    In 1998, the U.S. Navy determined, based on a 1978 Deed of Gift, \\nthat these human remains and associated funerary objects were in the \\ncontrol of the Bishop Museum. Based on the style and types of \\nassociated funerary objects, manner of interments, recovery locations, \\nand consultation information, these individuals have been identified as \\nNative Hawaiian. In keeping with prior consultations with Native \\nHawaiian organizations, the Bishop Museum did not attempt to determine \\nthe age of the human remains.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Bishop \\nMuseum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human \\nremains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 13 \\nindividuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bishop Museum \\nhave also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the 62 \\nobjects listed above are reasonably\\n\\n[[Page 46716]]\\n\\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \\nLastly, officials of the Bishop Museum have determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity \\nwhich can be reasonably traced between these Native American human \\nremains and associated funerary objects and Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O \\nHawai\\'i Nei.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hui Malama I Na \\nKupuna O Hawai\\'i Nei, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the O\\'ahu Island \\nBurial Council, and Koa Mana. Representatives of any other Native \\nHawaiian organization that believes itself to be culturally affiliated \\nwith these human remains and associated funerary objects should contact \\nValerie Free, Unit Manager, Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, 1525 Bernice \\nStreet, Honolulu, HI 96817; telephone: (808) 847-8205, before September \\n27, 1999. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects to Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai\\'i Nei may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: August 8, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
