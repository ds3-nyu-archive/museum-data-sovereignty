The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology and San Juan National Forest professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, Arizona and California; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Jicarilla Apache Tribe of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, New Mexico; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians of Utah; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Between 1921 and 1924, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were recovered from a site near Chimney Rock, Archuleta County, CO, by a team led by J.A. Jeancon, curator of archeology at the Colorado State Museum.  Other members of the team included Dr. E.B. Renaud, founder of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology, Frank H.H. Roberts, of the University of Denver, and his brother Henry B. Roberts.  No known individuals were identified.  The nine associated funerary objects are one grey ceramic jar with weathered black designs, seven nonhuman bones, and one lot of plant fiber.\\n        The recovery site is part of the San Juan National Forest.  The human remains were found in the jar, which had been placed in a cist in a pithouse on Stollsteimer Mesa, at the junction of the Piedra River and Stollsteimer Creek.  The pithouse was on the western side of the mesa, above the river.  The site is near the Chimney Rock site (5AA245) which dates to the Pueblo II (A.D. 800-1125) period.  There is a connection between the remains listed in this notice and Chimney Rock.  The research of Jeancon, Roberts, and recent investigators has firmly established that the ceramic/architectural sites in the Piedra River drainage in the vicinity of Chimney Rock are Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) in nature and are generally contemporaneous with the occupations at Chimney Rock.\\n\\n        The area around Chimney Rock is referred to as the Piedra-Pagosa Region and the Piedra District, and has been identified as the ancestral territory of the Hopi, Pueblo of Acoma, Pueblo of Cochiti, Pueblo of Isleta, Pueblo of Jemez, Pueblo of Laguna, Pueblo of Nambe, Pueblo of Picuris, Pueblo of Pojoaque, Pueblo of San Felipe, Pueblo of San Ildefonso, Pueblo of San Juan, Pueblo of Sandia, Pueblo of Santa Ana, Pueblo of Santa Clara, Pueblo of Santo Domingo, Pueblo of Taos, Pueblo of Tesuque, Pueblo of Zia, Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, Zuni Tribe, Skull Valley Ute, Southern Ute, Uintah and Ouray Ute, and Ute Mountain Ute.  The scientific literature provides significant evidence of cultural affiliation between Ancestral Puebloan culture and the Pueblos of today.  Representatives of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona, the Pueblo of Acoma, the Pueblo of Isleta, the Pueblo of Jemez, the Zuni Tribe of Arizona, and the Navajo Nation provided written and oral testimony confirming the cultural affiliation of contemporary Puebloan peoples with Ancestral Puebloan culture.  Consultation evidence also indicates affiliation with the Navajo and Jicarilla Apache as well as the Hopi, Pueblo of Acoma, Pueblo of Cochiti, Pueblo of Isleta, Pueblo of Jemez, Pueblo of Laguna, Pueblo of Nambe, Pueblo of Picuris, Pueblo of Pojoaque, Pueblo of San Felipe, Pueblo of San Ildefonso, Pueblo of San Juan, Pueblo of Sandia, Pueblo of Santa Ana, Pueblo of Santa Clara, Pueblo of Santo Domingo, Pueblo of Taos, Pueblo of Tesuque, Pueblo of Zia, Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, Zuni Tribe, Skull Valley Ute, Southern Ute, Uintah and Ouray Ute, and Ute Mountain Ute.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology and San Juan National Forest have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of two individuals of Native American ancestry.  Officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology and San Juan National Forest also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the nine objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.  Lastly, officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology and San Juan National Forest have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Jicarilla Apache Tribe of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, New Mexico; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians of Utah; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, Arizona and California; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Jicarilla Apache Tribe of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, New Mexico; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians of Utah; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.
