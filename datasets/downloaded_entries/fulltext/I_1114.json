The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Karshner Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Coeur D\\'Alene Tribe of the Coeur D\\'Alene Reservation, Idaho; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians of Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Coquille Tribe of Oregon; Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians of Oregon; Cowlitz Indian Tribe, Washington; Hoh Indian Tribe of the Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington; Jamestown S\\'Klallam Tribe of Washington; Kalispel Indian Community of the Kalispel Reservation, Washington; Klamath Tribes, Oregon; Lower Elwha Tribal Community of the Lower Elwha Reservation, Washington; Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation, Washington; Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington; Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington; Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho; Nisqually Indian Tribe of the Nisqually Reservation, Washington; Nooksack Indian Tribe of Washington; Port Gamble Indian Community of the Port Gamble Reservation, Washington; Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington; Quileute Tribe of the Quileute Reservation, Washington; Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, Washington; Samish Indian Tribe, Washington; Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington; Shoalwater Bay Tribe of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation, Washington; Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington; Snoqualmie Tribe, Washington; Spokane Tribe of the Spokane Reservation, Washington; Squaxin Island Tribe of the Squaxin Island Reservation, Washington; Stillaguamish Tribe of Washington; Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, Washington; Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation, Washington; Tulalip Tribes of the Tulalip Reservation, Washington; and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe of Washington (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The Karshner Museum also consulted with the following non-Federally recognized Indian groups: The Aleut Corporation; Chinook Tribe; Duwamish Tribe; Kikiallus Nation; Marietta Band of Nooksack Indians; Sealaska Corporation; Snohomish Tribe; Snoqualmoo Tribe; Steilacoom Indian Tribe and the Wanapum Band (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Indian Groups\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Prior to 1924, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals were removed from an unknown location in either Washington State, Southeast Alaska, or Western Oregon.

Dr. Karshner transferred the remains at an unknown date to his prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9e Dr. Thomas H. Clark. Dr. Clark donated the remains to the Karshner Museum in 1982 (accession #1982.10; catalog number 1982.10.17-111). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        The remains were identified at the Karshner Museum in December 2007. There is no provenience information for the remains; however, research by the Karshner Museum has resulted in a reasonable determination that the remains were collected from either Washington State; Southeast Alaska; or Western Oregon. Dr. Karshner lived primarily in Puyallup, WA from 1905-1951 but was known to travel widely and collect items during his trips. Although he traveled throughout the United States and internationally, museum records indicate he only removed NAGPRA items from Washington State, Southeast Alaska, and Western Oregon.\\n        The Karshner Museum received a formal joint claim for these remains from the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon; Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington; and Samish Indian Tribe, Washington.\\n        Determinations Made by the Paul H.
