The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Sarpy County, NE.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NSHS professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1954, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from archeological site 25SY15 in Sarpy County, NE. In 1883, one or more burials reported to be affiliated with Chief Big Elk and the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska were uncovered during construction of Bellevue College and reburied on campus. In June 1954, during construction work on the campus, the reburied remains were removed, and were reinterred in Bellevue Cemetery; members of the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska and a chaplain from nearby Offut Air Force Base officiated. The NSHS was involved in the 1954 exhumation, during which it collected several human bone fragments and a sample of associated funerary objects. These human remains and funerary objects have been curated at the NSHS. The age and sex of the individual are indeterminate. No known individual was identified. The 47 associated funerary objects are one spoon, one knife with bone handle, one pair scissors, three brass ornaments, one brass bracelet, one brass fragment, one whetstone, two copper ear bobs, one military button, one box of fabric, six kettle fragments, five knife blade fragments, 13 metal fragments, four mussel shells, two spoon fragments, one metal strainer, two wood fragments, and one mammal canine tooth.\\n        The associated funerary objects are consistent with assemblages found in 19th century Native America interments. All archival information appears to indicate that interments containing such assemblages of funerary objects are culturally affiliated with the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska. However, the small sample of human remains and associated funerary objects collected precludes a specific association with Chief Big Elk.\\n        Determinations Made by the NSHS\\n        Officials of the NSHS have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 47 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Rob Bozell, Nebraska State Historical Society, P.O.
