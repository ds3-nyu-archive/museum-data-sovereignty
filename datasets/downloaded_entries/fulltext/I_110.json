The excavation, undertaken by the Department of Anthropology at Oregon State University (OSU) at the request of the OPRD was for the purpose of salvaging burials eroding out of the river near the boat landing in Bullards Beach State Park. No known individuals were identified.\\n        Most of the human remains belonging to these two individuals were returned to the Coquille Indian Tribe for reburial in 1987. The human remains in this notice were not returned at that time. The 27 associated funerary objects are one lot of unknown metal fragments; one lot of wood and shell fragments; two lithics; three lots of shell fragments; one lot of seed and bone fragments; one lot of flakes; one lithic; one lot of unidentified bone fragments and lithics; three lots of lithic fragments; one lot of shell and bone fragments; one lot of fire cracked rock; one lot of unidentified shell fragments; two lots of mussel shell fragments; one metal spike; and seven lots of lithic material.\\n        The Hanis and Miluk Coos were known as the Coos Bay Indians in 1935 when the Coos Indians asserted in the United States Court of Claims that their aboriginal land extended two miles south of the Coquille River. The Hanis Coos, who inhabited the Coos Bay area and points south as far as Tarheel or Pigeon Point, are the ancestors of the modern day Coos section of the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians. The Coquille Indian Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians include descendants of the Miluk Coos. Beginning around Pigeon Point, including South Slough, and going south to the mouth of the Coquille River, the language spoken in the lower Coos Bay area was Miluk. The Upper Coquille shared the Coquille River watershed with the Miluk Coos. The Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Reservation, Oregon, are a confederation of 30 bands whose ancestral territory ranged along the entire Oregon coast and Coast Range, inland to the main divide of the Cascade Range and southward to the Rogue River watershed. The principal tribes include the Clatsop, Chinook, Klickitat, Molala, Kalapuya, Tillamook, Alsea, Siuslaw/Lower Umpqua, Coos, Coquille, Upper Umpqua, Tututni, Chetco, Tolowa, Takelma or Upper Rogue River, Galice/Applegate and Shasta. The ancestors of the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Reservation spoke at least 10 different base languages. In general, five linguistic stocks\\xe2\\x80\\x94Salish, Yakonan, Kusan, Takelman, and Athapascan\\xe2\\x80\\x94are represented by the tribes. The tribes were forcibly removed from their homelands in 1855 and placed on the Siletz and Grand Ronde reservations. Federal recognition of the tribes was terminated in 1954, but in 1977 the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Reservation, Oregon, were officially restored to recognized status. Historical, geographic, and linguistic evidence indicates the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon and the Coquille Indian Tribe are the most closely associated descendants of site 35CS3.\\n        Determinations Made by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department\\n        Officials of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 27 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon (previously listed as the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Reservation) and the Coquille Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Coquille Tribe of Oregon).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Nancy Nelson, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department Archaeologist, 725 Summer Street NE, Suite C, Salem, OR 97301, telephone (503) 986-0578, by May 24, 2019.
