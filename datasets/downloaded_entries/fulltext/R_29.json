Lane and F. Barnett. Lane and Barnett were accompanied by Arden King, who directed a University of Washington field school on San Juan Island from 1946-1947. The cultural item was accessioned by the Burke Museum in 1951 (Burke Accn. #3649) along with other archeological material from the field school. The one unassociated funerary object is a broken hammerstone.\\n        Guss Island, located in Garrison Bay on San Juan Island, is within the aboriginal territory of the Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation. Information provided during consultation indicates that it was used as a burial island, which corresponds with archeological evidence of Native American canoe burials on Guss Island. Lummi oral tradition and anthropological data clearly associate the Lummi with San Juan Island, including Guss Island (Suttles 1951, 1990). The archeological record shows continuous habitation from approximately 2000 years ago through the mid-19th century by Northern Straits peoples who were ancestral to the Lummi Tribe.
