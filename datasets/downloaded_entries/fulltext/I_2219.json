This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 43 CFR 10.2 (c). The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by University of Missouri-Columbia professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; and the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. \\n        Between 1939-1980, human remains representing a minimum of 114 individuals were recovered from site 23SA002 (Utz site), Saline County, MO during excavations conducted by University of Missouri-Columbia professional staff, supervised field school students, and volunteers of the Missouri Archaeological Society. No known individuals were identified. The 22 associated funerary objects include ceramic sherds, canine bones, limestone fragments, debitage, metal fragments, a shell gorget, burial soil, a biface, a terrapin carapace, faunal remains, a piece of daub, worked antler, and worked shell. \\n        Based on oral tradition, types of associated funerary objects, and historical documents, these individuals have been determined to be Native American. Based on radiocarbon dating, presence of trade objects, and historical documents, the Utz site has been identified as a village occupation estimating to date to approximately A.D. 1460-1712. Oral tradition, archeological evidence, and historical documents indicate the Utz site was a village of the Missouria Tribe and the burials are reasonably believed to be culturally affiliated with the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the University of Missouri-Columbia have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 114 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the University of Missouri-Columbia also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the 22 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the University of Missouri-Columbia have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma. This notice has been sent to officials of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; and the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated funerary objects should contact Dr. Michael J. O\\'Brien, Director, Museum of Anthropology, 317 Lowry Hall, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, telephone (573) 882-4421, before August 17, 2000. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma on behalf of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: June 22, 2000. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 00-18137 Filed 7-17-00; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service.
