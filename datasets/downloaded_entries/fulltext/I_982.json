Loomis, Professor of Geology at Amherst College. In the early 1980s, these remains were transferred from Amherst College to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Anthropology for permanent curation. Two additional individuals collected at the same time remained at Amherst College and are currently curated at the Beneski Museum of Natural History, Amherst College (formerly the Pratt Museum). These remains are the subject of a separate Notice of Inventory Completion.\\n        Most crania are marked with a red number that corresponds to an entry in a ledger entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCatalogue of Skeletal Material, Gilbert Museum of Indian Relics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Entries in that ledger read: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeminole from Melbourne Florida.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Although museum records regarding the human remains are fragmentary, provenience information associated with the remains indicates the following proveniences: 56 individuals from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrant Burial Heap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or simply from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrant, Fla.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; five individuals from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrant Burial Heap Linx, Fla.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; one individual from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBallard Mound\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and two individuals from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMicco, Fla.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present with the human remains at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\\n        Many of the remains have black numbers that resemble the numbering system used by F.B. Loomis in the field. Loomis was engaged in excavating in Florida in 1923 and 1925, at least. No field notes from Loomis\\'s excavations remain, but newspaper reports at the time indicate Loomis collected from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburial mounds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Melbourne Florida Times, December 5, 1923). The Boston Globe on November 1, 1925, reported Loomis and his coworkers excavated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin Melbourne and on the east coast of Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for five weeks and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat Vero Beach\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for two, obtaining \\xe2\\x80\\x9c50 skulls and about one dozen skeletons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This article also associates these mounds with Native Americans from southern rather than western Florida, based on the absence of pottery or tools in the mounds. No doubt, this conclusion derived from an interview with Loomis himself.

In this way the growth of the mound was effected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        On March 17, 1869, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the area of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaul Over Canal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Brevard County, FL, by unknown collectors. In or around 1939, the remains were donated to Amherst College, and, in the early 1980s, the remains were transferred to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Anthropology.
