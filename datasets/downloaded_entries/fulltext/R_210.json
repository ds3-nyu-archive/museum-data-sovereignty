It is unknown whether Emmons or Carl Spuhn, a manager with the Northwest Trading Company, originally acquired the two cultural items. The requested items consist of a large wooden box drum painted with the design of a wolf (Wolf Drum) and a steel, double-bladed dagger decorated with a design of a shark (Shark Dagger). Field Museum records indicate that the Wolf Drum was acquired sometime before 1900 from a Chief of the Taku Tribe who originally lived at Taku Harbor, AK, and who later moved to Gastineau Channel below Juneau. Field Museum records indicate that the Shark Dagger was acquired before 1900, and came from the Auk tribe living in Juneau, AK. The short upper blade is ornamented as a ground shark which was the totemic emblem of the family of the owner. Its eyes and teeth are embellished with Abalone shell. The dagger appears to be hafted, in part, with copper.\\n\\n        The cultural affiliation of the Wolf Drum is Taku Tlingit as indicated through museum records and consultation with representatives of the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes (Central Council). The Central Council has requested the Drum on behalf of the Yanyeidi clan of the Taku Kwan. The cultural affiliation of the Shark Dagger is Auk Tlingit as indicated by museum records and by consultation evidence provided by the Central Council. Museum records indicate that the Shark Dagger belonged to the family of a principal chief of the Auk tribe living at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSin-ta-ka heenee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Juneau). The Central Council requested the Shark Dagger on behalf of the Wooshkeetaan clan of the Auk Kwan.\\n        The 2 cultural items have been identified as Native American sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony through museum records, scholarly publications, primary documents, and consultation information provided by representatives of Central Council.\\n        Determinations Made by the Field Museum\\n        Officials of the Field Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the two cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the two cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony and the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Helen Robbins, Repatriation Director, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605, telephone (312) 665-7317, email hrobbins@fieldmuseum.org, by February 18, 2014.
