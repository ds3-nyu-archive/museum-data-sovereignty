The examination by the Collections Director and Physical Anthropologist identified human remains representing one additional individual and one associated funerary object from site 45 BN 81 and one associated funerary object from site 35 MW 10. In light of the findings from these examinations, the original notice of inventory is amended to include additions to the minimum number of individuals and associated funerary objects from 45 BN 81 site, and an addition of one associated funerary object for site 35 MW 10 (Tom\\'s Camp). \\n        The October 8, 2003 notice is corrected by substituting the following paragraphs:\\n        The following paragraph is substituted for paragraph 11:\\n        In 1963, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from site 45 BN 81 on Blalock Island, Benton County, WA, in the Columbia River within the John Day Dam project area.
