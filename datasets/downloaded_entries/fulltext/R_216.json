On an unknown date, Charles E. Strausenback of Espanola, NM, donated the items to the Colorado College Museum. In the late 1960s, the museum was closed and these items were placed on long-term loan to the Fine Arts Center (formerly known as the Taylor Museum and the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center).
