Similarities in site architecture and material culture associated with the human remains are consistent with Ancient Puebloan occupation of the southwestern United States from the Basketmaker I period through the Pueblo III period (between approximately 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1300).  The archeological literature refers to this widespread cultural tradition as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnasazi,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAncestral Puebloan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAncient Puebloan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Cranial modification is common to many Ancient Puebloan remains and is believed to reflect their widespread use of cradleboards to carry infants.  Ancient Puebloan ceramic typologies help to identify chronological and geographical technological traditions.  After approximately A.D. 1300, climatic changes evidently caused pueblo populations to leave the Four Corners region and resettle in Pueblos along the Rio Grande and in the Pueblos of Acoma, Zuni, and Hopi.

Ancient Puebloan sites in the southwestern United States generally date between approximately 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1300. \n The cultural affiliation of the human remains and associated funerary objects described above with present-day Native American tribes was determined through the use of the following lines of evidence: geographical, kinship, biological, archeological, anthropological, linguistic, oral tradition, historical, and expert opinion. Evidence was gathered from consultations with the Indian tribes listed above in Consultation, physical examination, survey of acquisitional history, review of pertinent archeological, ethnographic, historic, anthropological and linguistic literature, and artifact analysis. Similarities in site architecture and material culture associated with the human remains are consistent with Ancient Puebloan occupation of the southwestern United States from the Basketmaker I period through the Pueblo III period (between approximately 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1300).  The archeological literature refers to this widespread cultural tradition as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnasazi,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAncestral Puebloan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAncient Puebloan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Cranial modification is common to many Ancient Puebloan remains and is believed to reflect their widespread use of cradleboards to carry infants.  Ancient Puebloan ceramic typologies help to identify chronological and geographical technological traditions.  After approximately A.D. 1300, climatic changes evidently caused pueblo populations to leave the Four Corners region and resettle in Pueblos along the Rio Grande and in the Pueblos of Acoma, Zuni, and Hopi. Extant oral traditions corroborate dynamic population movements within the region during this time. \n \\n          Determinations.Under 25 U.S.C. 3003, museum officials have determined that the human remains represent the physical remains of 361 individuals of Native American ancestry. Museum officials determined that the 345 cultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Museum officials determined that the human remains and associated funerary objects are culturally affiliated with the Indian tribes listed in Summary. \n \\n          Notification.The museum is responsible for sending copies of this notice to the consulted Indian tribes listed above in Consultation. \n ", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
