The site is located near the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Between 1932 and 1939, an amateur collector conducted extensive excavations in the area. On June 2, 1933, the collector donated to the UMMAA ceramic sherds noted as coming from burials. Human remains from the site were donated by the collector to the UMMAA in May of 1935. UMMAA records for these collections and their excavation are minimal. The two individuals are one adult of indeterminate age and sex with a possible underlying infection, and one perinate child. The burials have been dated to the Mississippian Period (A.D. 1000-1400) based on the associated funerary objects and chronometric dating. No known individuals were identified. The eight associated funerary objects are five lots of ceramic sherds, two lots of shell-tempered ceramic sherds, and one lot of various archeological materials comprised of ceramic sherds, a possible lithic scraper, and a lithic flake.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Michigan\\n        Officials of the University of Michigan have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on accession documentation and archeological context.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the eight objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian Tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Federal Claims, the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of The Chickasaw Nation.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects may be to The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Ben Secunda, NAGPRA Project Manager, University of Michigan, Office of the Vice President for Research, 4080 Fleming Building, 503 South Thompson Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1340, telephone (734) 647-9085, email bsecunda@umich.edu, by October 24, 2019.
