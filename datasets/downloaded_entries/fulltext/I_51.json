The human remains were acquired by Peter Pratt during SUNY Oswego\\'s archeology dig at the Colgan site (also known as Myles A. Colgan farm), and were subsequently returned to the school. The human remains belong to a young adult (16-25 years) of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        The Colgan site is identified as a late prehistoric village dating to approximately A.D. 1450-1550, based on the ceramic sequence and artifacts associated with its occupation (although the area is also close to a discovery location for Mastodon faunal remains).\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the site of Hunter\\'s Home (in the close vicinity of the Rogers Farm site), located in the Town of Savannah on a peninsular landform overlooking the Montezuma Marsh, in the very southeast corner of Wayne County, NY. The human remains were acquired by Peter Pratt during SUNY Oswego\\'s archeology dig at the Hunter\\'s Home site, and were subsequently returned to the school. The human remains belong to one adult (40-45 years) male, and one adult of indeterminate age (probably male). No known individuals were identified. The 960 associated funerary objects are 42 miscellaneous lithic pieces of unknown materials, eight decorated incised pottery body sherds, one chert flake, 14 assorted unidentified to species shell, 24 chert pieces, 46 unidentified lithic pieces of unknown materials, 99 plain and incised pottery body sherds, one piece of unidentified glass, 15 plain pottery body sherds, one chert projectile preform, six unidentified faunal bones, eight pieces of chert, 34 unidentified lithics, five unidentified lithic flakes, 26 unidentified lithics, one worked stone, two unworked pieces of shell, seven carbon samples, seven plain pottery sherds, one chert flake, one charcoal carbon sample, two fish bones, eight faunal bones, 34 unidentified faunal bones, one soil sample, eight plain pottery sherds, two botanical samples, two lithic flakes of unknown material, one unidentified lithic piece, one unidentified lithic piece, two lithic flakes of unknown material, 13 plain pottery body sherds, one unidentified faunal bone, one lithic flake of unknown material, one lithic flake of unknown material, two lithic flakes of unknown material, six flakes of unknown material, five flakes of unknown material, two flakes of unknown material, three flakes of unknown material, three flakes of unknown material, two flakes of unknown material, two chert flakes, five flakes of unknown material, four flakes of unknown material, one flake of unknown material, one flake of unknown material, three flakes of unknown material, one chert flake, 37 decorated and incised pottery body sherds, 32 unidentified lithics, 424 possible lithics/rocks, and one bag of dirt mixed with microartifacts.\\n        The site of Hunter\\'s Home is a large occupation village site that included camps, middens, and burials. The materials recovered in the vicinity of the site show a wide span of occupation from the Frost Island phase (1500-1000 B.C.), Woodland period (A.D. 1000-1600), and Contact period (A.D. 1600 to 1700).\\n        At an unknown date, human remains consisting, at minimum, of one individual were removed from the Nolan site, located just north of Ledward, in Cayuga County, NY. These human remains were transferred to SUNY Oswego at an unknown time. The human remains belong to one adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Nolan site is described as a late Prehistoric village occupation, dating to approximately A.D. 1450-1550, based on the ceramic sequence and associated artifacts.
