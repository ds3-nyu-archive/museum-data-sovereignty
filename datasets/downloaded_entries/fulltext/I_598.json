The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Burke Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation; Muckleshoot Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington); Nooksack Indian Tribe; Samish Indian Nation (previously listed as the Samish Indian Tribe, Washington); Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe; Snoqualmie Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Snoqualmie Tribe, Washington); Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians of Washington (previously listed as the Stillaguamish Tribe of Washington); Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation; Swinomish Indian Tribal Community (previously listed as the Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation of Washington); Tulalip Tribes of Washington (previously listed as the Tulalip Tribes of the Tulalip Reservation, Washington); and Upper Skagit Indian Tribe, (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Prior to 1995, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were probably removed from a shell midden in the northern Puget Sound region, WA, possibly from the 45-SK-7 archaeological site in Skagit County, WA. These human remains were identified in 1995 while completing an inventory for NAGPRA compliance. These human remains and associated funerary object were found in a box with a yellow Post-It note with \\xe2\\x80\\x9c45-SK-7?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d written on it. Also in the box were four human bones, one from King County and three from Siberia, identified by the catalog numbers written on them. While there is no known concrete documentation indicating the human remains were ever removed from 45-SK-7, human remains have been found in adjacent sites, and are commonly found in shell middens in the northern Puget Sound region. These human remains and funerary object are consistent with other burials from this area, therefor the Burke Museum feels these are most likely from that region. The Burke Museum is unable to make a cultural affiliation due to the lack of context and exact location information from which the burial was removed. Site 45-SK-7 is located on State Parks land. No known individuals were identified.
