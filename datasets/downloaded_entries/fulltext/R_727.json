Langdon of Sumner, WA. Associated documentation state \\nthat this pipe is the ``Pipe used by the Wisconsin Winnebago chief, \\nYellow Thunder (Wau-kaun-chah-zee-kah).\\'\\'\\n    Consultation evidence presented by representatives of the HoChunk \\nNation of Wisconsin confirms that this is the Yellow Thunder pipe used \\nin traditional lodge ceremonies. Representatives of the HoChunk Nation \\nhave also stated that this item is needed by traditional religious \\nleaders for the practice of traditional Native American religion by \\ntheir present-day adherents.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the State \\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin have determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2(d)(3), these three cultural items are specific ceremonial \\nobjects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the \\npractice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day \\nadherents. Officials of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin have \\nalso determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(d)(4), these two cultural \\nitems have ongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance \\ncentral to the tribe itself, and could not have been alienated, \\nappropriated, or conveyed by any individual. Lastly, officials of the \\nState Historical Society of Wisconsin have also determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(e), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the \\nHoChunk Nation of Wisconsin.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the HoChunk Nation of \\nWisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Representatives of any \\nother Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated \\nwith these objects should contact Ms. Jennifer Kolb, Director, Museum \\nArcheology Program, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 816 State \\nStreet, Madison, WI 53706; telephone (608) 264-6560; e-mail: \\n[emailÂ protected], before December 1, 1999.
