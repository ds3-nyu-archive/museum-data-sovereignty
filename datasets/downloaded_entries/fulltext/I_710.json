The human remains were removed from Tennessee.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NAGPRA Coordinator and museum staff of the Beneski Museum of Natural History, Amherst College, and their agents, in consultation with representatives of the Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Cherokee Nation; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); Shawnee Tribe; The Chickasaw Nation; The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Quapaw Tribe of Indians; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. Representatives of the Beneski Museum also contacted, but were not able to consult with, the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, Kialegee Tribal Town, and the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Tennessee. The remains consist of one cranium that is without the lower jaw, without part of the upper jaw, and missing many teeth. The cranium appears to have been modified during growth. It is markedly flattened in the forehead, and flattened and indented on the back of the cranium, opposite the forehead, so that the forehead and back of the cranium slope toward the top of the cranium. The sides of the cranium bulge out slightly, so that the face looks widened, especially in the cheekbones. Minor repairs in plaster or putty were made to the cranium at some time.\\n        The Beneski Museum of Natural History, Amherst College has no collection or provenience information for these remains. The only existing information derives from inked lettering on the cranium, which says: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian S. Tennessee Adult [male gender symbol] CW.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cranium also bears the numbers GT 2045 and A-32, neither of which corresponds to any cataloging system in use at any time in the history of the Beneski Museum.
