These human remains were likely obtained by the Department of Anthropology at The University of Tulsa from the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, OK, which obtained artifacts and human remains from the site in 1982. The human remains represent three adult females, three adult males, ten adults of indeterminate sex, one juvenile of indeterminate sex, and four infants. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        According to the Gilcrease Museum records, the McDuffie site (3CG21) is located near the town of Lunsford in Craighead County, AR. Excavation records indicate that the site consisted of a large village with two mounds. Non-destructive analysis indicates that the human remains are Native American. Cultural items associated with the human remains have been determined to date to the Middle Mississippian period (A.D. 1170-1300). Oral history evidence presented by representatives of The Quapaw Tribe of Indians indicates that the region has long been included in their traditional and hunting territory. French colonial records from 1700 also indicate that the Quapaw were known at that time to be the only Native American group present in the St. Francis River valley region where the McDuffie site is located. Based on the geographical location and the date of interment, the human remains are most likely to be culturally affiliated with The Quapaw Tribe of Indians.\\n        Determinations Made by the Department of Anthropology, The University of Tulsa\\n        Officials of the Department of Anthropology, The University of Tulsa, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 21 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and The Quapaw Tribe of Indians.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Thomas Foster, Department of Anthropology, The University of Tulsa, Harwell Hall, Tulsa, OK 74104, telephone (918) 631-3082, email thomas-foster@utulsa.edu, by October 23, 2017.
