Pawnee oral tradition states that the Central Plains Tradition people are ancestors to the Arikara and Pawnee, and possibly the Wichita. According to Pawnee oral history, the Plains Woodlands people are ancestors to the Pawnee, Mandan, Arikara, Hidatsa, and Crow. Oral history information has some of the people of Mill Creek staying behind and becoming part of the Central Plains Tradition based on common oral traditions through origin and corn stories.\\n        Museum officials have determined based on museum records, geographic location, Pawnee oral tradition, and anthropological research that the Central Plains Tradition people are ancestors to the Arikara and Pawnee, and possibly the Wichita.
