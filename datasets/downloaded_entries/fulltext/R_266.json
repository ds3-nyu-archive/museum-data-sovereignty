The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n\\n        In 1934, cultural items were removed from the Snaketown site (AZ U:13:1 (ASM)), on the Gila River Indian Reservation, Pinal County, AZ, during archeological excavations conducted by the Gila Pueblo Foundation of Arizona. In December, 1950, the Gila Pueblo Foundation closed and the collections were donated to the Arizona State Museum. Additional cultural items were removed from the same site in 1964-1965 during legally authorized excavations conducted by the University of Arizona under the direction of Emil Haury. Collections obtained during the University of Arizona excavations were accessioned by the Arizona State Museum at the conclusion of the project. The items were reportedly found in association with human burials, but the human remains are not present in the collections. The 30 unassociated funerary objects are 1 ceramic plate, 1 ceramic vessel leg, 27 ceramic sherds, and 1 chipped stone artifact. Other unassociated funerary objects from this site were published in Notices of Intent to Repatriate in the Federal Register (66 FR 15741-15742, March 20, 2001; 69 FR 76779-76780, December 22, 2004; and 71 FR 13164-13165, March 14, 2006).\\n        The archeological evidence, including characteristics of portable material culture, attributes of ceramic styles, domestic and ritual architecture, site organization, and canal-based agriculture of the settlement places the Snaketown site within the archeologically-defined Hohokam tradition, and within the Phoenix Basin local variant of that tradition. The occupation of the Snaketown site spans the years circa A.D. 500/700-1100/1150.\\n        Continuities of mortuary practices, ethnographic materials, and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman) and Puebloan cultures. Documentation submitted by representatives of the Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona, on April 13, 2011, addresses continuities between the Hohokam and the O\\'odham tribes.
