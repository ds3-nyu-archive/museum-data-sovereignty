The remains were disturbed during excavation for a house foundation. State Historical Society of Wisconsin staff investigated and discovered that a mound was being disturbed. The burial was discovered in backfill dirt, meaning the primary location of the burial within the mound could not be determined. The remains were determined to be those of an adult male. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1962, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals (F1996.21.1 and F1996.21.2) were removed from the Olson Site (47-DA-0089) in Dane County, WI. The remains were excavated by a WHS archeological crew from two sub-floor burial pits in a partially destroyed conical mound. They were determined to be those of an adult, possibly female, and a child of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1934, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (H13016) were removed from the Fuller Woods Mound Group (47-DA-0118) in Dane County, WI.

The remains were removed by WHS archeologist John Halsey from three conical mounds, which have since been destroyed. The remains were determined to be those of 30 subadults, 23 adult males, 11 adult females, and 14 adults of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are a group of chert flakes (1986.417.42), a chert biface fragment (1986.417.43), and a group of faunal bones (1986.417.44).\\n        In 1915, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (A02522 and 2011.115.11) were removed from the Dividing Ridge Mound Group (47-DA-0145) in Dane County, WI. The remains were discovered during the destruction of a linear mound above the Pieh gravel pit on the Lake Wingra Ridge. WHS archeologist Marion Cranefield was on site when a construction worker discovered the remains and assisted in the excavation.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals (F2013.199.1) were removed from the Arboretum Woods site (47-DA-0152) in Dane County, WI. The remains were excavated from a conical mound in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. They were determined to be those of an adult male and a sub-adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1922, human remains representing, at minimum, five individuals (1996.93.8) were removed from the Mendota Beach site (47-DA-0172) in Dane County, WI. The five burials were disturbed during excavation for a barn on land belonging to Magnus Swenson. Either Swenson or David Atwood donated the remains to the WHS the same year. The remains were determined to be those of five individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x94three elderly adults, one adult, and one juvenile\\xe2\\x80\\x94all of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1991, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (HP.DA-0237.1) were removed from the Springdale Mound Group (47-DA-0237) in Dane County, WI. The WHS was notified that a proposed Wisconsin Department of Transportation frontage road was going to be constructed through an area where an Indian mound once existed, possibly disturbing any burials that could remain. Staff monitored machine-stripping of the area to look for evidence of intact burials, and a small concentration of human bone was discovered and excavated. The remains were determined to be from an adult, possibly female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1929, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals (1950.1624) were removed from the Farwell\\'s Point Mound Group (47-DA-0255) in Dane County, WI.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1952, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1952.339) were removed from the Farwell\\'s Point Mound Group (47-DA-0255) in Dane County, WI. A femur fragment was discovered by WHS archeologists during the excavation of a mound adjacent to the superintendent\\'s residence at Mendota State Hospital. The mound had been disturbed in the recent past and an attempt had been made to restore it. The femur fragment was found in the disturbed area, suggesting that the burial had been destroyed by this disturbance. It was determined that the fragment was from a young adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1969A.42.104-.109) were removed from the Farwell\\'s Point Mound Group (47-DA-0255) in Dane County, WI. The remains were uncovered and donated to the WHS by Charles E. Brown. Neither sex nor age could be determined for the remains. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1987.33.3) were removed from the Morris Park Mound Group (47-DA-0267) in Dane County, WI. An excavation of the site was conducted by Victoria Dirst of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Bureau of Parks and Recreation in preparation for a road construction project. When the site was originally mapped in 1902, it contained six conical mounds, three panther effigy mounds, and two linear mounds. At the time of excavation, four of these mounds had been largely destroyed, but seven were still intact. The partially cremated remains were excavated from pit feature 3, located about 10 meters from Mound 1. The remains and associated funerary objects were given to the WHS in 1987 as part of a cooperative agreement between the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the WHS. Neither sex nor age could be determined for the remains. No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object consists of a group of chert fragments (1987.33.3.1).\\n        In 1928, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (A10120) were removed from the Crystal Lake Burials and Village site (47-DA-0335) in Dane County, WI. The remains were discovered by a road crew while excavating gravel. The burial was removed and reported to Sheriff Fred Finn, who gave the remains to the WHS. The remains were determined to be those of an adult male. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1929, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals (A12857) were removed from the Crystal Lake Burials and Village site (47-DA-0335) in Dane County, WI. The remains were discovered by a road crew while plowing the crest of a hill to excavate gravel. They notified the WHS of their discovery, and Charles E. Brown excavated the burials. Brown donated the remains to the WHS in 1935. The remains were determined to be those of an adult male, an adult female, and a fetus of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The associated funerary objects are a group of chert flakes and a fragmentary turtle carapace (A12857.1 and A12857.2).\\n        In 1932, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals (F1996.22.1) were removed from the Mendota Beach Burials site (47-DA-0382) in Dane County, WI. The burials were disturbed during road construction and were located about 300 feet from one another. One of the burials had previously been partially disturbed by digging for a flower bed on the neighboring property. William F. Wagner donated the remains to the WHS the same year. The remains were determined to be those of two adults, possibly a male and a female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1954, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1956.9) were removed from the Mendota Hills Bird Effigy site (47-DA-0409) in Dane County, WI. The remains were discovered during the mapping and partial excavation of a bird effigy mound by WHS archeologist Warren Wittry and a group of University of Wisconsin-Madison archeology graduate students. WHS was notified of the mound by a construction company after a bulldozer partially destroyed it during construction of the Mendota Hills Subdivision. During excavation, it was determined that the site had recently been looted, but the looters had not disturbed the burial pit. The remains were determined to be those of a child of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In 1929, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (F2008.42.1) were removed from the Woodward Shores Mound Group (47-DA-0530) in Dane County, WI. The remains were discovered when a bird effigy mound was dug into during construction of a home. The landowners, Dr. and Mrs. Samuel Harper, had been told to watch for burials as they dug into the mound and excavated the remains before continuing with the construction project. Three burials were found, but two of the burials were in a very poor state of preservation and were not saved by the excavators. Mrs. Harper contacted Charles E. Brown concerning the discovery and the remains were given to the WHS. The remains were determined to be those of an adult male. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1986, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1994.113.53) were removed from the Camp Indianola site (47-DA-0533) in Dane County, WI. Archeologist Victoria Dirst discovered the burial during an excavation of the site for the Department of Natural Resources, who transferred them to the WHS as part of cooperative agreement. The remains were determined to be those of an adult female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1915, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (1950.1225) were removed from the Nichols Mortuary Site (47-DA-1284) in Dane County, WI. William McClean uncovered two burials while plowing near the Yahara River Bank at the Nichols farm. McClean donated only a lumbar vertebra with a projectile point embedded in it, and none of the other human remains, to the WHS in 1917. The projectile point was recorded at the time of donation but was not present during re-cataloging in 1950. The vertebra was determined to be from an adult. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1954, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals (1956.23.1) were removed from the Nichols Mortuary Site (47-DA-1284) in Dane County, WI. The remains were excavated from Mound 2 by WHS archeologist Warren Wittry. The mound was excavated because it was being destroyed by a construction project. The remains were determined to be those of an adult female and an individual of indeterminate age and sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1995, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (HP.DA-1395.1) were removed from the Birmingham\\'s Knee Site (47-DA-1395) in Dane County, WI. A femoral condyle fragment was discovered by then state archeologist Bob Birmingham eroding out of tree roots along the lakeshore. No other skeletal material was recovered. The bone fragment was determined to be from an adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1900, human remains representing, at minimum, six individuals (A00031 and A02580.1) were removed from a gravel pit at an unknown site along Oregon Road in South Madison, Dane County, WI. Mr. Absalom Van Deusen donated the remains to the WHS that same year. The remains were loaned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Anthropology Department in 1949 and returned to the WHS in 2011. The remains were determined to be those of three adult males, one juvenile female, and two adults of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1939, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals (2011.115.3) were removed from an unknown site on the west end of Mendota Beach, in Dane County, WI. The remains were discovered by the landowner, Mr. F.W. Burton, while digging a cellar for his home. Burton contacted Charles E. Brown, who excavated the remains. At an unknown date, the remains were loaned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Anthropology Department and were returned to the WHS in 2011. The remains were determined to be those of two adult males and one adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified.
