The human remains and associated funerary objects were documented and collected and have been curated by the Fort Sill National Historic Landmark and Museum since excavation. No known individuals were identified. The 4,727 associated funerary objects are 25 brass wire bracelets, 25 unidentified metal fragments, 1 small box with hinged lid, 1 metal buckle, 1 metal ring, 7 pieces of metal earrings, 1 piece of leather, 40 shell hair pipes, 4 mammal bones, 25 fragments of fibrous material, 13 fragments of metal buttons, 13 historic pottery fragments with decoration, 145 sequins, 2,608 seed beads of various colors, 1,736 tubular beads, and 82 barrel shaped beads.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from unknown locations, presumably on Fort Sill property.
