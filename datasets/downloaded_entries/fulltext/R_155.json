Beard reportedly collected human remains from the sites, but none of Beard\\'s collections were returned to the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests. The four cultural items were collected from the surface in 1985. The County Line site is a prehistoric open site on a lower ridge spur and toe slope overlooking the St. Francis floodplain.
