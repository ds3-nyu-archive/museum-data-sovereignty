The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        The item is a coiled, cylindrical basket with black linear designs. \\n        At an unknown date, this basket was collected by Grace Nicholson at an unknown locality, but likely in California. It was donated to the Peabody Museum by Lewis Farlow in 1905. Museum documentation states that this item was \\xe2\\x80\\x9crescued from pyral fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The description of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpyral fire\\xe2\\x80\\x9d indicates that this item was intended to be burned as part of a funeral rite. The Peabody Museum is not in possession of the human remains.\\n        Museum documentation describes this item as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprobably Moquelumnan stock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoquelumnan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was used to describe Miwok people. Consultation evidence indicates that present-day groups which represent Miwok people are the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; California Valley Miwok Tribe, California; Chicken Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, California; Ione Band of Miwok Indians of California; Jackson Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), California; Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California; United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California; and Wilton Rancheria, California.\\n        Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B), the one cultural item described above is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and is believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary object and the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; California Valley Miwok Tribe, California; Chicken Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, California; Ione Band of Miwok Indians of California; Jackson Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California; Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), California; Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California; United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California; and Wilton Rancheria, California.\\n\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary object should contact Patricia Capone, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, 11 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138, telephone (617) 496-3702, before March 29, 2010.
