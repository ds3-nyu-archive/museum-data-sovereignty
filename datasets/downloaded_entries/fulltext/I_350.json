The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from a site in Yavapai County, AZ.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the Superintendent, Tuzigoot National Monument.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Tuzigoot National Monument professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Ak-Chin Indian Community (previously listed as the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona); Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai Reservation, Arizona); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1955, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a prehistoric village site located on the east side of the Clarkdale Smelter property in Yavapai County, AZ, by Ed Starkey and later donated to Tuzigoot National Monument. No known individuals were identified. The 22 associated funerary objects are 16 shell bracelets, 1 jar, and 5 bowls.\\n        The Ak Chin Indian Community of Maricopa (Ak Chin) Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona comprise one cultural group known as the O\\'odham. Material culture items found at the site, including associated funerary objects, demonstrate continuity between the people of the prehistoric village site located on the east side of the Clarkdale Smelter and the O\\'odham. These items include a Sacaton red on buff bowl and locally made plainware ceramics that are similar in construction and appearance to plainware ceramics made in lands attributed to the Hohokam archeological culture, commonly considered to be ancestral O\\'odham. Consultation with O\\'odham Tribes also indicates that oral traditions exist that describe ancestral O\\'odham people living in the Verde Valley.\\n        The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona, traces ancestry to Yavapai bands once living in the Verde Valley. Consultation with Yavapai Tribes indicates the existence of specific ancestral names for the sites in the Verde Valley and a belief that ancestors lived near the sites. Archeological sites identified as Yavapai have also been found near the prehistoric village site on the east side of the Clarkdale Smelter. Additionally, the prehistoric village site on the east side of the Clarkdale Smelter is identified as being within the Yavapai traditional lands.\\n        The Hopi Tribe of Arizona considers all of Arizona to be within traditional Hopi lands or within areas where Hopi clans migrated in the past. Evidence demonstrating continuity between the people that lived at the prehistoric village site on the east side of the Clarkdale Smelter and the Hopi Tribe includes archeological, anthropological, linguistic, folkloric and oral traditions. Ceramic vessels associated with the Kayenta tradition demonstrate continuity between the prehistoric village, and the Hopi people. During consultation, Hopi clan members also identified ancestral names and traditional stories about specific events and ancestral people in the Verde Valley.\\n\\n        The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai Reservation, Arizona) traces ancestry to Yavapai bands once living in the Verde Valley.
