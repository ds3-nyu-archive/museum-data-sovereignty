The Paa-ko skeletal collection was acquired through field excavations under the direction of Edgar L. Hewett along with the Museum of New Mexico and the University of New Mexico, working in cooperation with the Federal Works Progress Administration. The Paa-ko skeletal collection was sent to Spencer Rogers, the Scientific Director of the San Diego Museum of Man, in 1950. Dr. Rogers moved a portion of these remains to San Diego State College for research. Another portion of the Paa-ko skeletal collection was housed at the University of Southern California. When Dr. Rogers retired from San Diego State College in 1971, both collections were returned to the San Diego Museum of Man. No known individuals were identified.

In the total collection, 191 sets of remains are of prehistoric origin and 18 sets of remains are of historic origin. The Paa-ko site is believed to have had two periods of occupation, from approximately A.D. 1300 to 1425 and then again from approximately A.D. 1525 to 1626 or later, the latter period coinciding with the arrival of the Spanish in this region.
