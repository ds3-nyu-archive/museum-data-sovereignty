The human remains were removed from the Gila Valley in Arizona.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology professional staff in consultation with representatives of Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        In 1934, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals were removed from the Gila Valley in Arizona, by Dr. George Woodbury and others. The human remains were donated to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology by the Gila Pueblo Foundation through Dr. Woodbury in the same year. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Osteological characteristics indicate that the individuals are Native American. Museum documentation describes the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodern Papago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the group that is known today as the O\\'odham people. Given such a specific cultural designation, the interments likely date to the Historic or contemporary period, from the late 17th to the early 20th century. Oral tradition and historical documentation indicate that the Gila Valley in Arizona is within the aboriginal and historic homeland of the O\\'odham people during the Historic period. The present-day groups representing the O\\'odham people are the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Patricia Capone, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, 11 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, telephone (617) 496-3702, before July 21, 2004.
