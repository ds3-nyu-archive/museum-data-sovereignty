Excavations were carried out by Stanford University alumna, Mabel Louise Miller in 1895. She is known to have excavated a Native American cemetery abandoned around 1853 and located at a rancheria near Longville, in Plumas County. Miller gave the objects to the Leland Stanford Junior Museum in October 1916, and subsequently, the Museum transferred them to the Stanford University Department of Anthropology. Currently, the objects are housed in the Stanford University Archaeology Collections. The location of the human remains of the individual with whom the objects were placed is not known. The 21 unassociated funerary objects include 1 ferrous knife, 11 shell ornaments, 1 projectile point, 6 flakes, 1 hammerstone, and 1 string of shell beads.\\n        The funerary objects were determined to be affiliated with the Mountain Maidu based on documentation provided by Mabel Miller and consultation with representatives of the Greenville Rancheria (previously listed as the Greenville Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California), the Susanville Indian Rancheria, California, and with individual members of Mountain Maidu groups (Beverly Ogle, Trina Cunningham, and Melany Johnson). Beverly Ogle, whose family had exclusive use of the Longville cemetery, has requested the repatriation of these unassociated funerary objects as a lineal descendant of the individual with whom they were placed and has provided information sufficient to show her lineal descent from the Native American individuals buried in her family\\'s small cemetery during the middle to late 1800s.\\n        Determinations Made by Stanford University Heritage Services\\n        Officials of Stanford University Heritage Services have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 21 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.10(a)(1) and 43 CFR 10.14(b), Beverly Ogle is a lineal descendant of the individual with whom the 21 unassociated funerary objects were placed, and whose human remains are not under the control of Stanford University Heritage Services.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Dr. Laura Jones, Stanford University Heritage Services, 3160 Porter Drive, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94304, telephone (650) 723-9664, email ljones@stanford.edu, by August 4, 2016.
