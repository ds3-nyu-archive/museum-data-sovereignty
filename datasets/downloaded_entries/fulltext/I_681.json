The site (45-CA-26) is located within the current boundaries of the Makah Indian Reservation. In or about September 1963, Robert E. Greengo of the Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum was directed to the site by Mrs. Otis Baxter who advised that the wind had been blowing material out of the cut bank. Dr. Greengo found exposed human bones and other items that had been disturbed by the action of the surf and/or wind. Dr. Greengo returned in October 1963, in the company of Mr. and Mrs. Otis Baxter and collected bones and objects from the location that turned out to be site 45-CA-26. The collection has been housed at the Burke Museum since 1963. No known individuals were identified. The two associated funerary objects are an elk bone and a small bag of sand and crushed bone.\\n        Geographic, historic, and anthropological evidence indicates that the human remains are Native American. The site (45-CA-26) is a shell midden site located within the current boundaries of the Makah Indian Reservation. Burial of human remains in or near shell middens is consistent with Native American burial practices in the Pacific Northwest. This area was historically and prehistorically occupied by the Makah people for at least the past 4,000 years.\\n        Determinations Made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Burke Museum\\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Burke Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of five individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the two objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Anna Pardo, Museum Program Manager/NAGPRA Coordinator, U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 12220 Sunrise Valley Drive, Room 6084, Reston, VA 20191, telephone (703) 390-6343, email Anna.Pardo@bia.gov, by May 28, 2015.
