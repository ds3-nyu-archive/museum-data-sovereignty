The human remains were donated to the American Museum of Natural History by Dr. Joseph Simms in 1872.  No known individuals were identified.  No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains have been identified as Native American based on the presence of cranial deformation and museum documentation that refers to the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChinook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The crania exhibit intentional shaping of the type practiced by Chinookan groups that occupied the area around the Columbia River.
