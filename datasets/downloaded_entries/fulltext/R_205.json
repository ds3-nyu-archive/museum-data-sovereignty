The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item(s)\\n        All cultural items described below were removed from lands administered by the USDA Forest Service in Coconino County, AZ, between 1934 and 1955. These items were collected by private individuals without permission or knowledge of the USDA Forest Service. Records kept by the individuals provide substantive evidence that the items were recovered in association with human remains from prehistoric archeological sites. The human remains were not collected, so these items are considered unassociated funerary objects. In 1981, these items were donated to a private museum, where they are currently housed, with the USDA Forest Service retaining legal control of the items. The site names listed below were used by the private individuals and are not official Forest Service site designations, except where noted.\\n\\n        In 1934, one ceramic vessel was removed from Big Ruin and one ceramic vessel was removed from Blind Ruin. In 1935, 10 ceramic vessels were removed from Dead Robin and one turquoise bead and one turquoise pendant were removed from Top of Hill. In 1936, five ceramic vessels, two shells and one painted conus shell were removed from an unnamed site. In 1937, one ceramic vessel and one bone awl were removed from an unnamed site. In 1938, five ceramic vessels were removed from an unnamed site and one ceramic vessel and one shell bracelet were removed from Two Handles. In 1939, one ceramic vessel was removed from Cold Banana, three ceramic vessels were moved from Big Tub, and two ceramic vessels were removed from Saddle (known as New Caves Hill by the USDA Forest Service). In 1940, 15 ceramic vessels were removed from 53 Ruin and nine ceramic vessels were removed from L.F. 1. In 1941, nine ceramic vessels, one shell necklace, and one projectile point were removed from Broken Fence and one shell object was removed from Keaster #1. In 1942, two ceramic vessels were removed from Cremation Ruin. In 1945, two ceramic vessels were removed from Mikes Mortuary. In 1946, 12 ceramic vessels were removed from 3/29/36 Ruin and one ceramic vessel was removed from Mikes Mortuary. In 1950, two ceramic vessels were removed from Old Caves Hill (the USDA Forest Service site name). In 1951, eight ceramic vessels were removed from Lost Plate. In 1952, 69 unassociated funerary objects were removed from an unnamed site; these consist of five ceramic vessels, four carved or worked bone items, 18 turquoise pendants, four shell necklaces, two strands of turquoise and argillite beads, five turquoise tesserae, four carved shell medallions, one stone medallion, one copper bead, three mosaic pieces, three stone or shell beads, three nose plugs, six crystals, two shells, one projectile point, one painted bark wand, and six unmodified rocks. In 1955, two ceramic vessels were removed from Stone Crusher and one ceramic vessel was removed from Big Ruin.\\n        The USDA Forest Service completed a cultural affiliation assessment in 1996 for prehistoric archeological remains in the Coconino County, AZ, region. The unassociated funerary objects listed in this notice were removed from sites related to the Northern Sinagua archeological culture.
