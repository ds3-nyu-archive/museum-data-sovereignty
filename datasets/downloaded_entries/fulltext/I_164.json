The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects was made by TVA professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Cherokee Nation; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); The Chickasaw Nation; The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma; hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Consulted Tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        From June 23 to August 19, 1976, human remains representing, at minimum, 13 individuals were removed from site 40HW44 in Hawkins County, Tennessee, by the Office of Archaeological Research at the University of Alabama (OAR). TVA acquired this site on April 25, 1975 for the Phipps Bend Nuclear Power Plant project. TVA canceled the planned construction in the 1980s, and subsequently transferred this land to the Industrial Development Board of Hawkins County. This village site was explored using controlled surface collection, trenches, and five randomly placed 1x1 meter excavation units. Sixty-three features (pits, post molds and burials) were excavated. Five radiocarbon dates place the primary occupation during the Early Woodland (1000-300 B.C.) period.\\n        The human remains are primarily adult males. No known individuals were identified. The 132 associated funerary objects include two animal bone fragments; one animal tooth pendant; one antler handle; two beaver incisors; one bone bullroarer; one bone pin; 23 pieces of chert debitage; 69 drilled bear canines; one Ebenezer PP/K; one greenstone celt; 17 Greenville Cluster PP/K; one piece of ground limestone; one ground steatite object; one piece of ground sandstone; one hammerstone; one limestone celt; three Long Branch Fabric Marked sherds; two chert preforms; one piece of red ochre; and two soapstone pendants.\\n        From September 20 to November 15, 1976, human remains representing, at minimum, five individuals were removed from site 40HW45 in Hawkins County, Tennessee, by OAR.

TVA canceled the planned construction in the 1980s, and subsequently transferred this land to the Industrial Development Board of Hawkins County. The site was explored using controlled surface collection, an eight meter long stratigraphic trench, and five randomly placed 2x2 meter excavation units. One hundred-twenty-four features, primarily pits of varying sizes, were excavated.
