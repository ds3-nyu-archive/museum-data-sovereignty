The remains were removed by Bob Atwell and Emil Gabeline and subsequently donated to the Burke Museum (Burke Accn. #1963-50). During initial consultations, the remains were believed to have been removed from Careless Bay in Island County, WA. The remains were included in a Notice of Inventory Completion published in the Federal Register (78 FR 45958-45959, July 30, 2013).

The Indian Claims Commission determined that Useless Bay was within the aboriginal territory of the Snohomish people. Holmes Harbor was one of the areas the Stillaguamish and other tribes were told to move to after being forced to leave their villages on the mainland (Deur 2009, Grady 2012).
