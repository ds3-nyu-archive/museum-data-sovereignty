Peabody Institute of Archaeology, Andover MA. The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Chequesset Inn-Taylor Hill site (19BN106), Wellfleet, Barnstable County, MA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        An invitation to consult was extended to the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe (previously listed as the Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribal Council, Inc.) and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Invited Tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation, a non-federally recognized Indian group, was also invited, but chose not to participate.\\n        The Invited Tribes either did not consult or engaged in limited communication. Determinations of cultural affiliation are based on prior and extensive consultation with these Indian Tribes and groups for other human remains and associated funerary objects from the same site and vicinity.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        At an unknown date early in the twentieth century, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Chequesset Inn-Taylor Hill site (19-BN-106) in Barnstable County, MA. Research by archeologist James W. Bradley (2008) indicates that avocational archeologist Howard Torrey removed human remains from the Chequesset Inn-Taylor Hill site, and gave some of these human remains to avocational archeologist Fred Luce in 1915. During an inventory project in 2018, staff members of the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology located 6 boxes of objects from Cape Cod area sites that had been amassed by Fred Luce in the early twentieth century. Examination by physical anthropologist Harley Erickson found that the human remains consist of two heavily eroded human bone fragments\\xe2\\x80\\x94a distal end of a metatarsal and a medial hand phalanx. Both are from an adult of indeterminate sex and age. No known individuals were identified. The 56 associated funerary objects are six modified animal bone fragments; 22 ceramic fragments, some decorated (including small bag of ceramic dust and debris); and 28 small, unmodified shells. (Three other individuals and eight associated funerary objects from Taylor Hill and excavated by Howard Torrey and archeologist Ripley R. Bullen in 1946 and 1949 were listed by the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology in a Notice of Inventory Completion published in 2005, and have already been repatriated.)\\n\\n        The Chequesset Inn-Taylor Hill site is reported in archeologist James W. Bradley\\'s 2008 article \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaylor Hill: A Middle Woodland Mortuary Site in Wellfleet, MA,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Bulletin of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society. The site dates to the late Middle Woodland era (circa 1100 to 1300 years B.P.), and is described by Bradley as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconcentration of late Middle Woodland habitation and mortuary sites located at the head of Wellfleet Harbor on Cape Cod.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These sites lie within the historically documented territory of the Wampanoag. In his 1928 monograph, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTerritorial Subdivisions and Boundaries of the Wampanoag, Massachusett, and Nauset Indians,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Indian Notes and Monographs No. 44, 1928) Frank Speck places the area around Wellfleet within the traditional territory of the Wampanoag. Linguistically, this area is within the so-called n-dialect shared by Massachusett, Wampanoag, and Pokanoket speakers (see map and discussion in Kathleen J. Bragdon\\'s 2009 book Native Peoples of Southern New England, 1650-1775, pages 22-23). Sociopolitical and economic patterns in the coastal area of Rhode Island and Massachusetts were established by the late Woodland period circa A.D. 1000, and the coastal groups in this area are likely the ancestors of the Wampanoag people encountered by the English in the seventeenth century. Archeology, ethno-history, linguistics, and oral history provide multiple lines of evidence that demonstrate longstanding ties between the Wampanoag and the area around the Chequesset Inn-Taylor Hill site and affirm affiliation with the burial at the site.\\n        Determinations Made by the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology\\n        Officials of the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 56 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and The Invited Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Ryan Wheeler, Robert S.
