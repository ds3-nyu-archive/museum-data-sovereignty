Later, the hat passed from the collectors to Dorothy K. Haberman, who was Miss Vaughn\\'s daughter. Mrs. Haberman donated the hat to the Oakland Museum of California in 1959. The sacred object/object of cultural patrimony is a clan crest hat in the shape of a frog carved from wood and with copper overlay on formline. The eyes are overlaid with abalone and the hat is topped with five woven spruce root rings.\\n        Oral traditions say that the Tlingit Indians have inhabited Southeast Alaska since time immemorial.

An ancestress of the clan obtained rights to the Frog crest on the Shtaxh H\\xc3\\xa9en. The Frog Hat is considered a sacred object/object of cultural patrimony because of its status as at.\\xc3\\xb3ow\\xe2\\x80\\x94a clan owned object brought out in ceremonies by a clan appointed caretaker and an object that could not be alienated without the consent of the entire clan.
