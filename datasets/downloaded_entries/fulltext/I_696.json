Strong brought the human remains to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), where they were placed on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpermanent loan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The cranium had suffered extensive postmortem damage and was partially restored at the AMNH by Kenneth Mowbray at some date prior to 2002. In January 2002, a detailed assessment of the human remains was made by researchers at Columbia University, and in August 2011, the AMNH transferred the human remains to the Department of Anthropology at Columbia University. The remains consist of a cranium representing one adult individual. This individual was identified as Native American based on Strong\\'s documentation and non-invasive assessment of cranial features. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Strong, in his expedition field notes (National Anthropological Archives, Strong Papers, Box 21, Field Work 1938), refers to beginning excavations at Sheyenne-Cheyenne site on July 8, 1938 (p.19a). He writes of the discovery of a partial bundle burial just beyond the edge of the house. It is initially identified as Burial #12, and later as Burial 1 #12 at House 23. W.

Two years later, in Strong\\'s 1940 work (Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 100:353-394), he provides the date of 1770 for the abandonment of the site. He explained that Swanton (1930), drawing on Thompson, believed that the village had been burned not much before 1790, while Henry (1897) \\xe2\\x80\\x9crefers to the same event as occurring about 1740.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At this point, Strong \\xe2\\x80\\x9cassumed 1770 as a median date\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (p. 371).
