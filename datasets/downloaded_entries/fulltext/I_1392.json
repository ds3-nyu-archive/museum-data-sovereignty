The human remains were removed from Border Field State Park, San Diego County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by California Department of Parks and Recreation professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Cuyapaipe Community of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation (formerly the Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California); and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California.\\n        In 1976, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from archeological site CA-SDI-4281, located on Lichty Mesa within Border Field State Park in San Diego County, CA, during excavations by Jeffery C. Bingham, State Parks archeologist. The remains were identified as human remains in the archeology lab. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n\\n        The carbon 14 date of the materials surrounding the human remains indicated that the dates for the site were from 4340 \\xc2\\xb1 50 to 3840 \\xc2\\xb1 60 years before the present. Based on this dating, the human remains were determined to be Native American. The Kumeyaay Indians (historically also listed as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiegueno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSouthern California Mission Indians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) of Western San Diego County are the Native peoples currently associated with archeological sites in this area. Based on the location of discovery and age of the human remains, the officials of the California Department of Parks and Recreation reasonably believe the human remains to be Kumeyaay. The descendants of the Kumeyaay are members of the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Cuyapaipe Community of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation; and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California.\\n        Officials of the California Department of Parks and Recreation have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the California Department of Parks and Recreation also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Cuyapaipe Community of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation; and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Rebecca Carruthers, California Department of Parks and Recreation, 1416 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, telephone (916) 653-8893, before May 4, 2009.
