This notice corrects the minimum number of individuals and the number of associated funerary objects. Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, or Native Hawaiian organizations stated in this notice may proceed.\\n        \\n        \\n          DATES:\\n          Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to the Robert S.

Peabody Institute of Archaeology, Andover, MA. The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Etowah site, Bartow County, GA and Little Egypt site, Murray County, GA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n\\n        This notice corrects the number of human remains and associated funerary objects published in a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register (70 FR 54075-54076, September 13, 2005). During a re-inventory inconsistencies in the original count of both the minimum number of individuals and associated funerary objects were identified. One individual had been counted twice; an additional individual was identified; and objects associated with the additional individual, which had previously been identified as unassociated funerary objects, were now designated associated funerary objects. Confusion regarding which individuals were from Etowah versus Little Egypt also was resolved with the re-inventory. Additionally, the re-inventory correlated original ledger book entries with cataloged and re-cataloged objects, thus identifying previously unknown burial associations. Finally, many associated funerary objects that were misidentified or miscounted in the original inventory (likely due to attempts to count the large numbers of shell beads) were corrected, identified and counted. Transfer of control of the items in this correction notice has not occurred.\\n        Correction\\n        In the Federal Register (70 FR 54075, September 13, 2005), column 2, paragraph 4, sentence 1 is corrected by substituting the following sentence:\\n        \\n        \\n          Between 1925 and 1928, human remains representing a minimum of 94 individuals were removed from the Etowah site, Bartow County, GA, by Warren King Moorehead of the Robert S.
