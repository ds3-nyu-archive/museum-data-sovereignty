The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Coso Junction Ranch Site, Inyo County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Fowler Museum at UCLA professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Big Pine Band of Owens Valley Paiute Shoshone Indians of the Big Pine Reservation, California; Death Valley Timbi-Sha Shoshone Band of California; Duckwater Shoshone Tribe of the Duckwater Reservation, Nevada; Fort Independence Indian Community of Paiute Indians of the Fort Independence Reservation, California; Paiute-Shoshone Indians of the Bishop Community of the Bishop Colony, California; and the Paiute-Shoshone Indians of the Lone Pine Community of the Lone Pine Reservation, California.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1983, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Coso Junction Ranch Site (CA-INY-2284), located at the south end of Inyo County, CA. No known individuals were identified. The 27 associated funerary objects are 1 awl, 1 bone tool, 2 obsidian biface fragments, 9 bags of obsidian debitage, 4 stone metate fragments, 4 bags of animal bone, 1 obsidian hydration sample, and 5 bags of organic flotation residue.\\n\\n        The collection was excavated in the course of a UCLA Field School conducted in the summer of 1983 under the supervision of David Whitley. The Coso Junction Ranch Site (CA-INY-2284) was a large village site located at the south end of Inyo County, CA. The site dates from about 3500-800 BP (David Whitley, January 20, 1996 email), and mostly from the Gypsum and Rose Spring periods based on analysis of diagnostic artifacts and obsidian hydration dating. The Fowler Museum at UCLA has determined the human remains and associated funerary objects to be Panamint Shoshone, ancestors of the present-day the Death Valley Timbi-Sha Shoshone Band of California and the Paiute-Shoshone Indians of the Lone Pine Community of the Lone Pine Reservation, California, based on ethnography, the prehistoric distribution of Numic languages, and various treaties, Acts of Congress, and Executive Orders.
