The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; and with the Michigan Anishinaabek Cultural Preservation & Repatriation Alliance, a non-federally recognized entity, representing the following federally recognized tribes: Bay Mills Indian Community, Michigan; Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Michigan; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Michigan; Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Michigan; Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan; Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan; Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, Michigan (previously listed as the Huron Potawatomi, Inc.); Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan; and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Michigan, hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Consulted Tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        At an unknown date between 1836 and 1839, human remains representing, at minimum, five individuals (UPM #: 97-606-35; 97-606-44; 97-606-78; 97-606-563; 97-606-1220) were removed by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworkers digging for buildings, roads, or gardens\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from an unknown mound site in Milwaukee County, WI. The human remains were discovered in the vicinity of Milwaukee and acquired by Increase A. Lapham, who at the time was conducting a survey of mounds in Wisconsin. Prior to 1839, Mr. Lapham sent the human remains to Dr. Samuel G. Morton for inclusion in his collection of human crania from around the world. The human remains represent a single individual, most likely female, 25-35 years of age; an adult female 50+ years of age; an adult male 30-40 years of age; an adult male 35-40 years of age; and an adult male 50+ years of age. Each of the five individuals is represented by a cranium without a mandible. The condition of all of the human remains is consistent with burial. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date between 1820 and 1837, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (UPM #: 97-606-454) were removed from an unknown site in Michigan or Wisconsin by Dr. Richard S. Satterlee, Assistant Surgeon for the U.S. Army. In this capacity, Dr. Satterlee served at the Detroit Barracks, MI, Fort Howard, WI, Fort Mackinac, MI, Fort Winnebago, WI, and for a second term at Fort Howard, WI. It is during this time that the human remains were collected. In 1837, Satterlee was sent to Florida. The human remains were transferred to Dr. Samuel Morton in Philadelphia for inclusion in his collection of human crania from around the world prior to 1839. The human remains are those of a single female individual estimated to be 20-30 years old and are represented by a cranium and mandible. There is little pathology represented on the bones and teeth, and the condition of the human remains suggests they were not buried. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual (UPM #: 97-606-1222) were removed from an unknown site, possibly in Michigan. Prior to 1849, Mr. John P. Wetherill of Philadelphia sent the human remains to Dr. Samuel G. Morton. The human remains are represented by a cranium and mandible of a single male, 30-40 years of age. This individual is identified as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNatonake, a Menominee Chief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At this time, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia provided storage space for much of Dr. Morton\\'s collections, including these human remains, until his death in 1851. In 1853, Dr. Morton\\'s collection, including all of the human remains described above, were purchased from Dr. Morton\\'s Estate and formally presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1966, Dr. Morton\\'s collection was loaned to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. In 1997, the collection was formally gifted to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.\\n        Museum collections and published literature indicate that the seven sets of human remains date to the Historic Period. The human remains have been identified as Native American based on the specific cultural and geographic attributions in the museum records. Collector\\'s records, museum documentation and published historical sources identify the human remains above as Menominee. Scholarly ethno-historic and anthropological publications and land cession records indicate that the areas from which the human remains were removed are within the traditional aboriginal territory of the Menominee Indians, and historic Menominee occupation sites within these areas have been identified.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology \\n        Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 7 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Julian Siggers, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 3260 South Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, telephone (215) 898-4050, by September 2, 2016.
