The human remains were removed from 45BN3, a village site located on Berrian\\'s Island, in Benton County, WA.\\n\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        \\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, and UO-MNCH professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation of Oregon; Nez Perce Tribe, Idaho; and the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian Group.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1948 and 1949, human remains representing, at minimum, seven individuals were removed from 45BN3, a pre-contact protohistoric village site located on the south side of Berrian\\'s Island, in Benton County, WA. Site 45BN3 is located within the McNary Lock and Dam Project on the Columbia River. The McNary Lock and Dam Project is managed by the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, who initiated land acquisition processes for the Project in 1947.\\n        In 1947, the Smithsonian Institution\\'s River Basin Survey Project (SRBS) surveyed and surface collected material cultural remains from site 45BN3. In 1948, the SRBS excavated the site and removed 50 burials and 1,650 artifacts. Many of the burials were recovered in situ and were bounded by wood. Originally identified as cists, this wood was later determined to be the burnt remains of conical wood stacks that had been erected over the burials. The associated funerary objects included copper, iron, glass trade beads, shell ornaments and stone implements. Following completion of field investigations, the collections were transported to the SRBS laboratory at the University of Oregon. In 1949, the SRBS returned to site 45BN3 and salvaged four additional burials that had been looted by amateur collectors.\\n        The collections recovered through the SRBS investigations were transferred to three separate repositories: the Smithsonian Institution; the University of Washington (UW) Burke Museum, Seattle, WA; and UO-MNCH, Eugene, OR. The portions of the collections held at UO-MNCH were accessioned between 1950-1952, and include materials from Burials 4-5, 7-9, 11-15, 19, 22, 24-26, 32, 34, 36-37, 39, 41, 43, 45-46, 48-49, and 51-54. Materials from the 1948 and 1949 SRBS collections at UO-MNCH were inventoried in 1985 and again in 1996. The remains of seven individuals (accession #100KT/MP) were documented through the inventory. Due to an absence of associated documentation, these seven individuals cannot be connected to specific burials. The remains are those of an adult male, an adult female, two adults of indeterminate gender, two children and another individual of indeterminate age and gender. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The estimated date range of the other burials from site 45BN3 is 1750-1811, based upon the presence of Colonial uniform buttons whose earliest manufacture date is c.1750 and the absence of firearms, whose use by local tribes began c.1811. Further evidence supporting the date of these burials is the volume of trade goods observed in both the burials and in the living area. Site 45BN3 was also reported to have contained evidence of contemporaneous mat lodge pits. Distinctive morphological traits, burial methods and associated funerary objects indicate Native American ancestry and funerary traditions reflective of Native groups of the Columbia Plateau.\\n        Determinations Made by the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District\\n        Officials of the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9)-(10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of seven individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation of Oregon; and the Nez Perce Tribe, Idaho (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).
