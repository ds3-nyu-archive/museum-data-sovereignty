Mr. Nesbitt spent 10 weeks excavating site 13JK66, where he encountered human skeletal remains. In 2014, during examination of the faunal remains from the site, three human bone fragments and one complete human bone were found by an OSA faunal analyst. These human remains were then deaccessioned from the Logan Museum\\'s collection and transferred to the OSA-BP. Based on archeological evidence, the human remains likely date from the Middle Archaic to Oneota periods, and represent a middle-aged/older adult of indeterminate sex and a later-term fetus/newborn (BP 3016) of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 13JK80 in Jackson County, IA.

No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 2011, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from site 13LA139 in Louisa County, IA, by unknown individuals. The area was inspected by investigators from the State Medical Examiner\\'s Office, local law enforcement officers, and OSA-BP Director Shirley Schermer. Upon further investigation, two additional burials were discovered by OSA-BP personnel. As the remains were not of medico-legal significance, they were transferred to the OSA-BP in 2011. Site 13LA139 is a documented Late Woodland and Oneota habitation site. The human remains represent a subadult approximately 4.5 to 4.8 years old of indeterminate sex, and two adults of indeterminate sex and age (BP 2600). No known individuals were identified. The 9 associated funerary objects include 2 pieces of chert debitage and 6 potsherds, and 1 lot of charcoal.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown location in Lee County, IA.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1999, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 13MC336 in Muscatine County, IA, during excavation for a home. The Iowa State Medical Examiner\\'s Office contacted forensic anthropologist Dr. Dawnie Steadman of Iowa State University who, with the assistance of personnel from the OSA-BP, examined the burial site. The human remains were ultimately removed, as they had been heavily disturbed by the excavation. Dr. Steadman performed an initial examination of the remains, after which they were transferred to the OSA-BP (in 1999). No artifacts diagnostic of time period or cultural affiliation were encountered during excavation. The human remains represent a child approximately eight years old (BP 1295) of unknown sex.

The human remains were retrieved by the Pottawattamie County Sheriff\\'s Department criminalist, who transferred them to forensic anthropologist Dr. Dawnie Steadman, then at Iowa State University. After determining the remains were prehistoric, Dr. Steadman transferred the remains to the OSA-BP. The human remains consist of a cranium and mandible representing a middle-aged adult male (BP 1342). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In 2009, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the south slope of site 13PW43 in Pottawattamie County, IA, by an OSA-BP archeologist. In 1924, Charles R. Keyes dated site 13PW43 to both the prehistoric and historic periods and identified Native American burials there. The human remains consist of a bone fragment representing one individual of indeterminate age and sex (BP 2418). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 2001, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from site 13PW176 in Pottawattamie County, IA, during construction of a retaining wall. The incident was reported to the Pottawattamie County Sheriff\\'s Office and treated as a forensic case. The human remains underwent forensic analysis by Dr. Dawnie Steadman then at the State University of New York. As the results of C14 analysis indicated that a femur dated to approximately A.D. 1190, and a tibia dated to approximately A.D. 184, the possibility that the remains were of medico-legal significance could be excluded. In 2002, the human remains were transferred to the University of Iowa OSA-BP. The human remains represent a juvenile of indeterminate sex, 14-20 years old; and a slightly older juvenile/young adult of indeterminate sex (BP 1570). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.  \\n        In 2013, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a sandbar along the Skunk River in the city of Ames in Story County, IA. The human remains were transferred to the Story County Sheriff and then to the Iowa State Medical Examiner\\'s Office. The Medical Examiner determined that the human remains were ancient, and transferred them to the OSA-BP in 2013. No other provenience information is available. The human remains consist of a partial cranium representing an adult female approximately 30-40 years old (BP 2912). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 2014, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Big Sioux Wildlife Area in Sioux County, IA, by a private individual. The human remains were sent to the Iowa State Medical Examiner\\'s Office (case #14SME544). The human remains, which had been found near a Native American burial site (13SX12) of unknown cultural affiliation, were determined to be prehistoric and were transferred to the OSA-BP in 2014. The human remains consist of a partial mandible representing an adult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 3072). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from an unknown location in Union County, IA. In 2013, museum staff at the Iowa State Historical Society located three boxes containing the human remains of several individuals. The human remains were catalogued between 1914 and 1935, but no other provenience information is available. The human remains were transferred to the OSA-BP in 2013, and represent two middle-aged adults of indeterminate sex; and a subadult approximately 9-9.5 years old (BP 2926). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 13WB215 in Webster County, IA. In 2009, the human remains were identified among archeological material belonging to the Russ Campbell Collection, which is housed at the Humboldt County Historical Association\\'s Mill Farm Historical Museum in Dakota City, IA. The human remains were transferred to the OSA-BP in 2009. Site 13WB215 was occupied from the Middle Archaic to post-Woodland periods, and includes a cemetery associated with Middle and Late Woodland components. The human remains consist of a cranial fragment representing an adult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 2412). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from site 13WB357 in Webster County, IA, by a private individual. The human remains are reported to have been located in pit silo burials encountered by the individual\\'s grandfather and great-grandfather in the 1930s. The pit silo burials may have been associated with site 13WB357, a conical mound of unknown cultural or temporal affiliation. The remains were transferred to the University of Iowa OSA-BP in 2008.

No other provenience information is available. The human remains consist of one cranial element (BP 3036), a vertebra, and a rib (BP 3037). They represent a middle-aged/older adult of indeterminate sex (BP 3036), and an adult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 3037). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, five individuals were removed from an unknown location in northern Winnebago County, IA. In 2015, the human remains were transferred to the OSA-BP by a private individual. The human remains represent one young/middle-aged adult male; two middle-aged to older adults of indeterminate sex; one possibly older adult of indeterminate sex and age; and one subadult approximately 2.5-3.5 years old (BP 3154).

The human remains were recovered by the Sac County Sheriff\\'s Department, and were transferred to the Iowa Office of the State Medical Examiner on July 12, 2016. The Medical Examiner sent the remains to Michael Finnegan of Forensic Anthropological Consultants in Manhattan, KS. Dr. Finnegan determined the remains were not of medico-legal significance and returned them to the Iowa State Medical Examiner after examination. The remains were then transferred to the OSA-BP on August 5, 2016. The human remains consist of a partial cranium representing a middle-aged/older Native American adult male (BP 3213). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On July 16, 2016, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 13SH74, in the West Nishnabotna River, in Shelby County, IA. The remains were recovered by the Shelby County Sheriff\\'s Department, and were transferred to the Iowa Office of the State Medical Examiner in Ankeny, IA. The Office of the State Medical Examiner transferred the remains to the OSA-BP in August 2016. The human remains consist of a complete cranium representing an older adult female (BP 3212). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1955, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Turin Site (13MN2), a Middle Archaic burial site in Monona County, IA. The remains were recovered during excavations conducted by Reynold J. Ruppe and W.D. Frankforter following the exposure of four burials during gravel mining operations. The majority of the human remains recovered during these excavations were reburied in 1988 and 1993. In 2011, additional remains representing a single individual were discovered in the collection of the late Adrian Anderson. The remains were transferred to the OSA-BP in 2011. The human remains represent a subadult aged approximately six to seven years (BP 2708). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.  \\n        In 2012 and 2014, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Woodpecker Cave site (13JH202) in Johnson County, IA. The site, which has both Archaic and Woodland components, was excavated by the University of Iowa Department of Anthropology field school. Isolated human elements (teeth and phalanges) were identified during laboratory processing and were transferred to the OSA-BP. The human remains represent two adults of indeterminate age and sex (BP 2755, 3039). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In June 2016, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 13CA75 in Cass County, IA. The human remains were discovered by boaters after being exposed on a sandbar in the East Nishnabotna River near Cold Springs State Park. The human remains were transferred to the Montgomery County Sheriff\\'s Office, then to the Cass County Sheriff\\'s Office, who transferred them to the Iowa State Medical Examiner\\'s Office. The State Medical Examiner determined that the human remains were greater than 150 years old and transferred them to OSA-BP. The human remains represent an adult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 3197). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1965, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Charles D. Johnson Mound (13PK33) in Polk County, IA. A salvage excavation of the Middle Woodland mound was conducted by an archaeological team from Iowa State University in cooperation with the National Park Service, prior to the destruction of the site during the relocation of the Wabash Railroad. Human remains recovered from this excavation were stored at the Iowa State University Archaeological Laboratory (ISUAL), and were transferred to the OSA-BP in 1991. The human remains represent one adult and one subadult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 522). No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is a ceramic vessel represented by 15 sherds.\\n        Although some of the human remains were removed from archeological sites from which Archaic, Woodland, and Great Oasis components could be identified, none of these archeologically-defined traditions can be reasonably traced to any present-day Indian Tribes. Although the Oneota tradition can be affiliated with present-day Indian Tribes, and was present at sites from which human remains were removed, there were also other traditions/components present, thus, the human remains and artifacts could not be associated with the Oneota phases.\\n\\n        At the time of the excavation and removal of these human remains and associated funerary objects, the land from which the remains and objects were removed was not the tribal land of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. The Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program consulted with The Tribes who are recognized as aboriginal to the area from which these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed. None of The Tribes agreed to accept control of the human remains and associated funerary objects.\\n\\n        Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(2)(ii), the Secretary of the Interior may make a recommendation for the culturally unidentifiable human remains and associated funerary objects with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctribal land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9caboriginal land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d provenience to be reinterred under State or other law. Since 2016, the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program has conducted consultations with The Tribes to develop an agreement, titled Process for Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating from Iowa (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Under The Process, the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) and The Tribes agree that OSA will reinter Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa according to Iowa law where: The Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa are under the control of OSA or the State Historical Society of Iowa (SHSI); OSA or SHSI has completed an inventory of these remains and objects, as required; OSA or SHSI has determined that these remains and objects are culturally unidentifiable; the Indian Tribe (if any) from whose tribal land, at the time of excavation or removal, the remains and objects were removed does not agree to accept control of the remains and objects; and no Indian Tribe that is recognized as aboriginal to the area from which the remains and objects were removed agrees to accept control of the remains and objects. In September 2018, OSA requested that the Secretary of the Interior, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee, approve the proposed reinterment of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects according to Iowa law and The Process. The Review Committee, acting pursuant to its responsibility under 25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(5), considered the request at its October 2018 meeting and recommended to the Secretary that such reinterments proceed. A December 2018 letter on behalf of the Secretary of Interior from the Acting Associate Director for Cultural Resources, Partnerships, and Science, National Park Service, transmitted the authorization for the reinterment of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa, according to The Process and NAGPRA, and pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.

A salvage excavation of the Middle Woodland mound was conducted by an archaeological team from Iowa State University in cooperation with the National Park Service, prior to the destruction of the site during the relocation of the Wabash Railroad. Human remains recovered from this excavation were stored at the Iowa State University Archaeological Laboratory (ISUAL), and were transferred to the OSA-BP in 1991. The human remains represent one adult and one subadult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 522). No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is a ceramic vessel represented by 15 sherds. \n Although some of the human remains were removed from archeological sites from which Archaic, Woodland, and Great Oasis components could be identified, none of these archeologically-defined traditions can be reasonably traced to any present-day Indian Tribes. Although the Oneota tradition can be affiliated with present-day Indian Tribes, and was present at sites from which human remains were removed, there were also other traditions/components present, thus, the human remains and artifacts could not be associated with the Oneota phases. \n At the time of the excavation and removal of these human remains and associated funerary objects, the land from which the remains and objects were removed was not the tribal land of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. The Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program consulted with The Tribes who are recognized as aboriginal to the area from which these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed. None of The Tribes agreed to accept control of the human remains and associated funerary objects. \n Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(2)(ii), the Secretary of the Interior may make a recommendation for the culturally unidentifiable human remains and associated funerary objects with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctribal land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9caboriginal land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d provenience to be reinterred under State or other law. Since 2016, the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program has conducted consultations with The Tribes to develop an agreement, titled Process for Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating from Iowa (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Under The Process, the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) and The Tribes agree that OSA will reinter Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa according to Iowa law where: The Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa are under the control of OSA or the State Historical Society of Iowa (SHSI); OSA or SHSI has completed an inventory of these remains and objects, as required; OSA or SHSI has determined that these remains and objects are culturally unidentifiable; the Indian Tribe (if any) from whose tribal land, at the time of excavation or removal, the remains and objects were removed does not agree to accept control of the remains and objects; and no Indian Tribe that is recognized as aboriginal to the area from which the remains and objects were removed agrees to accept control of the remains and objects. In September 2018, OSA requested that the Secretary of the Interior, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee, approve the proposed reinterment of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects according to Iowa law and The Process. The Review Committee, acting pursuant to its responsibility under 25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(5), considered the request at its October 2018 meeting and recommended to the Secretary that such reinterments proceed. A December 2018 letter on behalf of the Secretary of Interior from the Acting Associate Director for Cultural Resources, Partnerships, and Science, National Park Service, transmitted the authorization for the reinterment of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa, according to The Process and NAGPRA, and pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \n Determinations Made by the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program \n Officials of the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on their association with documented prehistoric and/or historic archeological sites, cranial and dental morphology when observable, and/or osteological signatures of the antiquity of remains, such as tooth wear and taphonomic processes. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 138 individuals of Native American ancestry. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 32 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian Tribe. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(2)(ii)(B), the human remains and associate funerary objects will be reinterred according to Iowa law and The Process. \n Additional Requestors and Disposition \n Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Lara Noldner, Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program, University of Iowa, 700 South Clinton Street, Iowa City, IA 52242, telephone (319) 384-0740, email lara-noldner@uiowa.edu, by April 17, 2019. After that date, if no additional requestors have come forward, the human remains and associated funerary objects may be reinterred. \n The Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program is responsible for notifying The Tribes that this notice has been published. \n ", "consultation": "A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; Lower Sioux Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Miami Tribe of Oklahoma; Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation (previously listed as the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, Kansas); Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; Sac & Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Sac & Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; Santee Sioux Nation, Nebraska; Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota; The Osage Nation (previously listed as the Osage Tribe); Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota; Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \n ", "h_d_r": "At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from an unknown location in the State of Iowa by a local avocational archeologist and transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program (OSA-BP) in 2016.

The incident was reported to the Pottawattamie County Sheriff\\'s Office and treated as a forensic case. The human remains underwent forensic analysis by Dr. Dawnie Steadman then at the State University of New York. As the results of C14 analysis indicated that a femur dated to approximately A.D. 1190, and a tibia dated to approximately A.D. 184, the possibility that the remains were of medico-legal significance could be excluded. In 2002, the human remains were transferred to the University of Iowa OSA-BP. The human remains represent a juvenile of indeterminate sex, 14-20 years old; and a slightly older juvenile/young adult of indeterminate sex (BP 1570). No known individuals were identified.

No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \n In 1955, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Turin Site (13MN2), a Middle Archaic burial site in Monona County, IA. The remains were recovered during excavations conducted by Reynold J. Ruppe and W.D. Frankforter following the exposure of four burials during gravel mining operations. The majority of the human remains recovered during these excavations were reburied in 1988 and 1993. In 2011, additional remains representing a single individual were discovered in the collection of the late Adrian Anderson. The remains were transferred to the OSA-BP in 2011. The human remains represent a subadult aged approximately six to seven years (BP 2708). No known individual was identified.

No associated funerary objects are present. \n In June 2016, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 13CA75 in Cass County, IA. The human remains were discovered by boaters after being exposed on a sandbar in the East Nishnabotna River near Cold Springs State Park. The human remains were transferred to the Montgomery County Sheriff\\'s Office, then to the Cass County Sheriff\\'s Office, who transferred them to the Iowa State Medical Examiner\\'s Office. The State Medical Examiner determined that the human remains were greater than 150 years old and transferred them to OSA-BP. The human remains represent an adult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 3197). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \n In 1965, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Charles D. Johnson Mound (13PK33) in Polk County, IA. A salvage excavation of the Middle Woodland mound was conducted by an archaeological team from Iowa State University in cooperation with the National Park Service, prior to the destruction of the site during the relocation of the Wabash Railroad. Human remains recovered from this excavation were stored at the Iowa State University Archaeological Laboratory (ISUAL), and were transferred to the OSA-BP in 1991. The human remains represent one adult and one subadult of indeterminate age and sex (BP 522). No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is a ceramic vessel represented by 15 sherds. \n Although some of the human remains were removed from archeological sites from which Archaic, Woodland, and Great Oasis components could be identified, none of these archeologically-defined traditions can be reasonably traced to any present-day Indian Tribes. Although the Oneota tradition can be affiliated with present-day Indian Tribes, and was present at sites from which human remains were removed, there were also other traditions/components present, thus, the human remains and artifacts could not be associated with the Oneota phases. \n At the time of the excavation and removal of these human remains and associated funerary objects, the land from which the remains and objects were removed was not the tribal land of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. The Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program consulted with The Tribes who are recognized as aboriginal to the area from which these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed. None of The Tribes agreed to accept control of the human remains and associated funerary objects. \n Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(2)(ii), the Secretary of the Interior may make a recommendation for the culturally unidentifiable human remains and associated funerary objects with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctribal land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9caboriginal land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d provenience to be reinterred under State or other law. Since 2016, the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program has conducted consultations with The Tribes to develop an agreement, titled Process for Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating from Iowa (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Under The Process, the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) and The Tribes agree that OSA will reinter Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa according to Iowa law where: The Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa are under the control of OSA or the State Historical Society of Iowa (SHSI); OSA or SHSI has completed an inventory of these remains and objects, as required; OSA or SHSI has determined that these remains and objects are culturally unidentifiable; the Indian Tribe (if any) from whose tribal land, at the time of excavation or removal, the remains and objects were removed does not agree to accept control of the remains and objects; and no Indian Tribe that is recognized as aboriginal to the area from which the remains and objects were removed agrees to accept control of the remains and objects. In September 2018, OSA requested that the Secretary of the Interior, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee, approve the proposed reinterment of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects according to Iowa law and The Process. The Review Committee, acting pursuant to its responsibility under 25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(5), considered the request at its October 2018 meeting and recommended to the Secretary that such reinterments proceed. A December 2018 letter on behalf of the Secretary of Interior from the Acting Associate Director for Cultural Resources, Partnerships, and Science, National Park Service, transmitted the authorization for the reinterment of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from Iowa, according to The Process and NAGPRA, and pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \n ", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Determinations Made by the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program \n Officials of the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on their association with documented prehistoric and/or historic archeological sites, cranial and dental morphology when observable, and/or osteological signatures of the antiquity of remains, such as tooth wear and taphonomic processes. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 138 individuals of Native American ancestry. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 32 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian Tribe. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(2)(ii)(B), the human remains and associate funerary objects will be reinterred according to Iowa law and The Process. \n ", "a_r_d": "Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Lara Noldner, Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program, University of Iowa, 700 South Clinton Street, Iowa City, IA 52242, telephone (319) 384-0740, email lara-noldner@uiowa.edu, by April 17, 2019.
