No known individuals were \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    Based on accession records, these human remains have been \\nidentified as Native American. Ethnohistoric information indicates the \\nUnshagi site has been identified as ancestral to the Pueblo of Jemez. \\nConsultation with representatives of the Pueblo of Jemez confirms that \\nthe Unshagi site was inhabited exclusively by ancestors of the Pueblo \\nof Jemez.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Los \\nAngeles County Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the \\nphysical remains of a minimum of six individuals of Native American \\nancestry. Officials of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History \\nhave also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and the Pueblo of Jemez.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Pueblo of Jemez. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Dr. \\nMargaret A.
