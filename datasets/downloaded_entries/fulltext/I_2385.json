No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary \\nobjects are present.\\n    In 1957, human remains representing five individuals were recovered \\nfrom the vicinity of Table Rock, Lake County, OR during excavations \\nwithout permit by Joan Oswalt. In 1960, Ms. Oswalt donated these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects to the Oregon State Museum. No \\nknown individuals were identified. The five associated funerary objects \\ninclude a shell necklace and chipped stone tools.\\n    Between 1967-1969, human remains representing five individuals were \\nrecovered from Table Rock caves, Lake County, OR during legally \\nauthorized excavations by the University of Oregon Museum of Natural \\nHistory. No known individuals were identified. The eleven associated \\nfunerary objects include woven matting, a winnowing tray, an obsidian \\ntool, and a basketry fragment.\\n    In 1968, human remains representing two individuals were recovered \\nfrom the vicinity of Table Rock, Lake County, OR during legally \\nauthorized excavations by Bureau of Land Management staff. No known \\nindividuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are \\npresent.\\n    Morphological evidence indicates these human remains are Native \\nAmerican based on dental wear and bone condition. Based on the \\ncontexts, manner of internment, and associated funerary objects, the \\nsites listed above have been determined to be precontact habitation \\nsites. Archeological and ethnographic evidence indicates these sites \\nare precontact Northern Paiute sites and burials based on continuities \\nof tool and basketry styles. Oral history evidence presented by \\nrepresentatives of the Burns Paiute Tribe of Burns Paiute Indian Colony \\nof Oregon during consultation supports this affiliation. Northern \\nPaiute people are represented by the present day tribes of the Burns \\nPaiute Tribe of Burns Paiute Indian Colony of Oregon, Confederated \\nTribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Klamath \\nIndian Tribe of Oregon.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Bureau \\nof Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof thirteen individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the \\nBureau of Land Management have also determined that, pursuant to 25 \\nU.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the sixteen objects listed above are reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \\nLastly, officials of the Bureau of Land Management have determined \\nthat, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared \\ngroup identity which can be reasonably traced between these Native \\nAmerican human remains and associated funerary objects and the Burns \\nPaiute Tribe of Burns Paiute Indian Colony of Oregon, Confederated \\nTribes of the Warm Springs Reservation\\n\\n[[Page 59371]]\\n\\nof Oregon, and the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Burns Paiute Tribe of \\nBurns Paiute Indian Colony of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the \\nWarm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Klamath Indian Tribe of \\nOregon. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects should contact Richard Hanes, Cultural Program Lead, \\nBureau of Land Management, P.O.
