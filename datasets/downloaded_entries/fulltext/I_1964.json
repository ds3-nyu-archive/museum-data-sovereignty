The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, Arizona and California; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        In 1953, human remains representing a minimum of one individual (catalog number DU 6000) were removed from Marsh Pass, Navajo County, AZ, by Arnold Withers, a University of Denver Department of Anthropology faculty member, who donated the remains to the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology the same year.  No known individual was identified.  No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The remains were found in a deserted hogan.  Marsh Pass is on the Navajo Reservation and is north of the Hopi Reservation.  Consultations with members of the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico NAGPRA committee determined that it is possible that the human remains in the hogan could be those of a Pueblo person living in or visiting the area.  They stated that Puebloan peoples were, and still are, resident all over the southwestern United States.  Consequently, they believe that the Pueblos should be considered culturally affiliated with these human remains. In addition, hogans are a Navajo form of habitation, and the Navajo have traditionally buried or placed their dead in hogans.  Consequently, it is believed that the Navajo should also be culturally affiliated with these remains.\\n        In 1944, human remains representing a minimum of one individual (catalog numbers DU 6014 and DU 6056) were removed from Shiprock, San Juan County, NM, possibly by Dr. E.B. Renaud, founder of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology.  No known individual was identified.  No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Shiprock is on the Navajo Reservation.  Consultations with members of the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico NAGPRA committee determined that Puebloan peoples were, and still are, resident all over the Southwestern United States.  Consequently, they believe that the Pueblos should be considered culturally affiliated with these human remains, as well as the Native American group on whose reservation the remains were found.\\n\\n        The area where these human remains were found has been identified as the ancestral territory of the Hopi and the Navajo.  Consultation evidence indicates cultural affiliation with the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and  Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry.  Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs; Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, Arizona and California; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of  Zia, New Mexico; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.
