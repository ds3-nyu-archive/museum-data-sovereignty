The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from an archeological site in Mason Valley, San Diego County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3).  The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Arizona State Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee on behalf of the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, California; Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Ewiiaapaayp Band of Kumeyaay Indians, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California.\\n        In 1924, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from site C-144 in Mason Valley, San Diego County, CA.  The human remains were in a ceramic vessel that was excavated by John Glenn and that was given to the San Diego Museum of Man.  In 1934, the vessel and the human remains were sent to the Gila Pueblo Foundation as part of an exchange. In December 1950, the Gila Pueblo Foundation donated the vessel and the human remains to the Arizona State Museum. No known individual was identified.  The 11 associated funerary objects consist of one ceramic cremation jar, four sherds of brown pottery, five charred seeds, and one group charred textile fragments.\\n        Based on ceramic material and the mortuary pattern, the human remains have been identified as Native American and date from the late Prehistoric period to the Historic period (circa A.D. 750-1870).  Continuities of material culture and technologies provide a clear continuum for native cultures in this area from the late Prehistoric period into the Historic period.  Historic documents from Spanish expeditions refer to Diegueno and Kumeyaay peoples living throughout this area.  Consultation information provided by the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee supports the recognition of this area of San Diego County as ancestral homeland to the Kumeyaay Indians.\\n        Officials of the Arizona State Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Arizona State Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.  Lastly, officials of the Arizona State Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, California; Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Ewiiaapaayp Band of Kumeyaay Indians, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact John Madsen, Repatriation Coordinator, Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, telephone (520) 621-4795, before November 12, 2004.
