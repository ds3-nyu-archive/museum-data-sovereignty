Abstract\\n        The National Park Service (NPS) is requesting approval for a new collection of information in which scientists and members of the public will use iNaturalist to record natural history observations during NPS Bioblitz and other citizen science sponsored events. The NPS is requesting to use iNaturalist\\xe2\\x80\\x94a web-based tool program that will allow park visitors to record the natural history of wildlife, plant and other species observed inside NPS Park units and managed lands. These recorded observations will be used to supply NPSpecies biodiversity database with additional information not currently known about species in the parks. The participation of citizen scientists via iNaturalist provides immediate on-site input that is often not available with the current level of NPS staffing.\\n        II.
