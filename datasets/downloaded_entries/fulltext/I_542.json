The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; Wyandotte Nation; and the Michigan Anishinaabek Cultural Preservation and Repatriation Alliance (MACPRA), a non-federally recognized entity which represents the following federally recognized groups: Bay Mills Indian Community, Michigan; Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Michigan; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Michigan; Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Michigan; Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan; Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan; Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Pottawatomi, Michigan (previously listed as the Huron Potawatomi, Inc.); Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan; and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Michigan.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1844, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed by Lt. Montgomery C. Meigs from an unknown mound site in Wayne County, MI. According to museum and archival documents, the human remains were discovered in the immediate vicinity of Detroit and sent to Samuel G. Morton for inclusion in his collection of human crania from around the world prior to 1846. The human remains are represented by a cranium (no mandible) of a single adult female 35-45 years of age and a cranium (no mandible) of a probable male 30-40 years of age. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date prior to 1839, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed by Dr. George Mendenhall from an unknown site in Cuyahoga County, OH, and were sent to Samuel G. Morton for inclusion in his collection of human crania from around the world prior to 1846. According to museum and archival documents, the human remains were discovered near Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, OH. The human remains are represented by a cranium (no mandible) of a single female 35-45 years of age. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date prior to 1839, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed by Dr. Sturum from an unknown location near Detroit, Wayne County, MI. After his death, the human remains came into possession of the executor of Sturum\\'s estate and were sent to Samuel G. Morton for inclusion in his collection of human crania from around the world prior to 1846. The human remains are represented by a cranium and mandible of a male, 50+ years of age. Museum and archival documents identified this individual as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchief, who was slain in a broil with his son-in-law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Dr. Morton published his collection in several catalogues (1839, 1840, and 1849). In 1853, Dr. Morton\\'s collection, including all the human remains described above, were purchased from Dr. Morton\\'s estate and formally presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1966, Dr. Morton\\'s collection was loaned to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. In 1997, the collection was formally gifted to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.\\n        Literature from the museum, collectors, and publications indicate that the four sets of human remains date to the Historic Period. The human remains have been identified as Native American based on specific cultural and geographic attribution in the museum records. Collector records, museum documentation and published sources identify the human remains above as Wyandot (Huron). Scholarly publications and land cession records indicate that the areas from which the human remains were removed are within the traditional aboriginal territory of the Wyandot (Huron) Indians and many known historic Wyandot (Huron) occupation sites within these areas have been identified.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\\n        Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and Wyandotte Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Julian Siggers, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 3260 South Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, telephone (215) 898-4050, by July 8, 2016.
