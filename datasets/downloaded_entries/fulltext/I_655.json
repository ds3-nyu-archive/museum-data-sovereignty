The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Anthropology Research Collections at Texas A&M University (ARC-TAMU) professional staff in 1995. In 2015, representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe; and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma, were invited to consult with ARC-TAMU for the purpose of determining the place and manner of repatriation.

The human remains from the site were identified as being from Feature 14 a and b (TAMU-NAGPRA 76). The human remains were determined to be one adult of indeterminate sex.

Archeological and linguistic evidence, historical records, and/or traditional beliefs indicate that there is a relationship of shared group identity between these historic groups and the present-day Caddo Nation of Oklahoma; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe; and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma.\\n        Determinations Made by the Anthropology Research Collections at Texas A&M University\\n        Officials of the ARC-TAMU have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe; and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. David Carlson, NAGPRA Coordinator, Department of Anthropology, TAMU MS 4352, College Station, TX 77843-4352, telephone (979) 845-5242, email dcarlson@tamu.edu, by September 30, 2015.
