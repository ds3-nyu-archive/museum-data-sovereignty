Archeologists from the UMMAA excavated three low, conical mounds on the bank of the Menominee River. Two features within one of the mounds held human remains and funerary objects. In one feature, the human remains consist of 1 child, 4-8 years old, sex indeterminate, and an infant, sex indeterminate. Another feature within the mound, described as a rock-capped ossuary, held the human remains of, at minimum, 18 individuals. The human remains consist of 1 older adult, possibly female; 1 adult female over 50 years old; 4 adult males over 50 years old; 1 adult female over 40 years old; 1 adult male, 30-50 years old; 1 adult male, 35-49 years old; 1 adult male, 30-40 years old; 1 young adult, possibly male, 20-35 years old; 1 adult male, age indeterminate; 1 young adult female, 20-25 years old; 1 adolescent, 11-14 years old, sex indeterminate; 1 child, 8-10 years old, sex indeterminate; 1 child, age and sex indeterminate; 1 neonate; and 1 cremated adult. One lot of DNA extractions, taken from the human remains in this collection between 1996 and 2006, are also included in this notice. The burials have been dated to the Late Woodland Period (A.D. 1350, +/\\xe2\\x88\\x92110 years) based on Carbon 14 analysis of charcoal from the site. No known individuals were identified. Three associated funerary objects found in the mound fill are one copper spear point; one perforated long bone fragment, possibly deer; and one lot of beak fragments from a female eagle.\\n        The human remains have been determined to be Native American, based on cranial morphology and dental traits. A relationship of shared group identity can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains from this site and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, based on multiple lines of evidence. The mode of burial, specifically ossuary burial within a conical mound, suggests a merging of practices between the large ossuary burials recorded at late pre-contact sites in the northern Great Lakes area and earlier practices of mound burial observed among northern forager groups. The ceramic assemblage collected from contemporary midden deposits identified at the site is strongly suggestive of Algonquian origin. The site is located within the aboriginal lands of the Menominee as described in traditional and historical accounts, and at a date that makes these descriptions relevant.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Michigan\\n        Officials of the University of Michigan have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 20 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 3 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Ben Secunda, NAGPRA Project Manager, University of Michigan, Office of Research, 4080 Fleming Building, 503 Thompson Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1340, telephone (734) 647-9085, email bsecunda@umich.edu, by July 14, 2017.
