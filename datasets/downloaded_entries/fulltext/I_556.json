The human remains were collected by F.M. Hayes, and later donated by Mrs. F. Griffin to the UC Davis Zoology Department. The Zoology Department later became part of the College of Biological Sciences. The collections of the College of Biological Sciences were later transferred to the UC Davis Museum of Wildlife and Fish Biology within the Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        The human remains have been determined to be Native American based on dental wear patterns and the archeological context of the site. The human remains were not removed as a part of a systematic excavation; however, multiple subsequent archeological excavations at site CA-YOL-118 and surrounding sites yielded relevant information. The human remains are reasonably believed to date to Phase 2 of the Late Period (A.D. 1520-1770) or to the later Historic/Mission Period based on the presence of temporally diagnostic artifacts including clam shell disc beads, glass beads, and Olivella H series beads, as well as radiocarbon dating. Archeological and linguistic models suggest individuals of southern Wintun or Patwin descent were present at site CA-YOL-118 during the Late and Historic Periods.
