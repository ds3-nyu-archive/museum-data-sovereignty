Wengler excavated the ulumaika from a grave \\nin the suburbs of Honolulu on the Island of O\\'ahu, HI. Also prior to \\n1913, Mr. Wengler sold or traded this ulumaika to Mr. William H. \\nEllsworth of Milwaukee, WI. In 1913, Mr. Ellsworth donated this \\nulumaika to the Milwaukee Public Museum.\\n    Based on known Native Hawaiian tradition and practices, this \\ncultural item is consistent with Native Hawaiian funerary objects. \\nCollections documentation and consultation evidence presented by Hui \\nMalama I Na Kupuna O Hawai\\'i Nei support the conclusion that this \\ncultural item was placed with human remains.\\n    Officials of the Milwaukee Public Museum have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), this cultural item is reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and is \\nbelieved, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from \\na specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of \\nthe Milwaukee Public Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between this item and Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O \\nHawai\\'i Nei.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hui Malama I Na \\nKupuna O Hawai\\'i Nei and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with this object should contact Ann McMullen, \\nPh.D., Curator of North American Ethnology, Milwaukee Public Museum, \\n800 West Wells Street, Milwaukee, WI 53233; telephone: (414) 278-2786; \\nfax: (414) 278-6100 before December 17, 1998. Repatriation of this \\nobject to Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai\\'i Nei may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: November 5, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
