On February 1, 1968, Paul Stewart and Lawrence Parsons found the remains weathering out of a cliff crevice. Mr. Stewart and Mr. Parsons were in the Turkey Creek area of Pueblo Reservoir making field investigations for the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. The Project office notified the archeologist who had made the survey of Pueblo Reservoir, Dr. Arnold Withers of the University of Denver. Several months passed before Dr. Withers visited the site and by then it had been vandalized. The burial was photographed and a memo written about it by employees of the Bureau of Reclamation. The burial contained an adult, flexed, head to the southeast, probably with knees partly under the body. Sex was not determined. Traces of ash and charcoal possibly indicate the individual was partly cremated. The remains were said to have a greenish cast. The memo stated that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpart of the skeleton, including half the skull was later recovered and sent to the University of Denver.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1998, human remains (DU#1987.1.1) were found in collections at the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology during an inventory of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Archeological collection. The remains, approximately 37 fragments of cranium, were found in a box labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTurkey Creek.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Approximately half of the fragments show signs of burning. The remains were of an adult and have a very faint green hue. The University of Denver Museum of Anthropology has determined that the remains found in collection (1987.1.1) were removed from the Turkey Creek Crevice Burial (5PE4277).\\n        The Bureau of Reclamation does not believe that the geographical affiliation of the human remains found in the collection at the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology (1987.1.1) can be identified as the Turkey Creek Crevice Burial (5PE4277).
