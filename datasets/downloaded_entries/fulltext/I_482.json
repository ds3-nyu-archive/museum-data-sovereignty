The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Wisconsin Historical Society and Lawrence University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation of Wisconsin; the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan; and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Between 1968 and 1973, human remains representing, at minimum, 12 individuals were removed from the Rock Island II site in Door County, WI. During that time period, extensive excavations of the southwestern portion of the island were conducted by Lawrence University under the direction of archaeologist Ronald Mason. One component of the site was an early historic Native American village and associated cemetery located in the eastern portion of the site and used between 1760 and 1770. Excavation of the cemetery uncovered fourteen burials with remains representing twelve individuals, including an adult male, an adult female, and ten juveniles all under the age of twelve, and their associated funerary objects; two burials no longer contained remains but did contain funerary objects. The remains and most of the associated funerary objects are currently in the physical custody of Lawrence University, but under the control of the Wisconsin Historical Society as the Rock Island II site is located on state land. No known individuals were identified. The 228 associated funerary objects are 14 lots of wood fragments from coffins, 20 lots of beads, 3 samples of red ochre, 2 spoons, 2 samples of vermilion, 1 polished pebble, 7 brass trade kettles, 3 unidentifiable objects, 1 cut and polished shell, 1 lot of silver brooches, 18 individual brooches, 6 silver brooches attached to a fabric fragment, 10 earrings, 1 bell or cup, 3 pendants, 1 wooden paint box, 1 perforated elk tooth, 1 lot of tinklers, 5 individual tinklers, 1 thimble, 10 lots of textile fragments, 1 silver cross, 4 armbands, 5 knives, 1 lot of burned faunal remains, 3 firesteels, 2 awls, 1 catlinite pipe, 2 necklaces, 7 Jesuit rings, 2 samples of charred organic materials, 1 musket, 1 French perfume bottle, 6 gunflints, 1 musket ball, 4 pieces of shot, 2 hairpullers, 1 mirror in shards, 1 sheet of folded brass, 1 kettle handle, 1 pipe tomahawk head, 1 lot of nails, 1 lot of bird bone tubes, 1 lot of antler fragments, 2 bells, 8 scraps of brass, 8 pieces of brass wire, 1 piece of cut iron, 1 piece of lead, 2 pieces of worked wood, 3 silver cylinders, 1 embellished antler tine, 1 carved stone, 2 pot sherds, 20 flint chips, 1 bone comb, 2 ear ornaments, 1 hafted iron ax, 1 cup, 1 French pistol, 2 brass bells, 8 bracelets, 1 limestone cobble, and 1 plaque.\\n        The Rock Island II site is a multi-component site that was episodically occupied starting in the Middle Woodland period. Mason identified four phases of early historic Native American occupation. He attributed the occupation associated with the village and cemetery to the Odawa due, in part, to the 1766 account of Jonathan Carver, a European-American, of spending time with the Odawa there. One of the burials in the cemetery was partially cremated, which Mason noted was uncommon in the Great Lakes region during this period, but accounts from this time referenced this practice among several clans of the Odawa and one Potawatomi clan. According to evidence provided by the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians in Michigan, the village and associated cemetery were Odawa, with some Menominee, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi individuals living there because of intermarriage.\\n        Determinations Made by the Wisconsin Historical Society\\n        Officials of the Wisconsin Historical Society have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 12 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 228 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians of the Bad River Reservation, Wisconsin; the Bay Mills Indian Community, Michigan; the Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan; the Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin; the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation of Wisconsin; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Michigan; the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Michigan; the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan; the Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan; the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin; the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, Michigan (previously listed as the Huron Potawatomi, Inc.); the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin; the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan; Sault Ste.
