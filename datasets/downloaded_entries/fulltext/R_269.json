The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item\\n        In 1929, one clay pipe (or bow pipe), about five inches in total length, was removed from archeological site SDM-W-1 (as named by archeologist Malcolm Rogers), also known as CA-SDI-39, generally referred to as the Spindrift site, located near the coast of the Pacific Ocean in present day La Jolla, CA. The pottery pipe is a bow-type with a beak-shaped holder and has diamond hatching incised about the bowl. It has a charred appearance, suggesting that it was burned. Shortly after its excavation, Malcolm Rogers transferred the clay pipe to the San Diego Museum of Man, where he was employed at the time.\\n        Malcolm Rogers\\'s 1929 excavation notes state that the pipe was discovered with one associated cremation, however, the cremated human remains do not reside at the Museum of Man. Kumeyaay tradition, confirmed through consultation with Kumeyaay representatives, also dictates that charred objects, such as this pipe, were part of burial offerings and were most likely associated to cremated human remains, most likely a male. Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the pipe is considered an unassociated funerary object. Clay pipes such as this one typically do not make an appearance in the archeological record until after A.D. 1000.
