These human remains were transferred to the \\nMaine State Museum in 1989 by the Smithsonian Institution. No known \\nindividual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    Osteological evidence indicates this individual is morphologially \\nconsistent with contemporary Native Americans. The overall condition of \\nthese human remains indicates they are probably attributable to the \\n16th century. Washington County, ME is located within the historically \\ndocumented territory of the Etchemin, from whom the Passamaquoddy Tribe \\ndescends. There is no evidence of any other cultural group living in \\nthis area during the 16th century.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Maine \\nState Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the \\nhuman remains listed above represent the physical remains of one \\nindividual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Maine State \\nMuseum have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there \\nis a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably \\ntraced between these Native American human remains and the \\nPassamaquoddy Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Aroostook Band of \\nMicMacs, Houlton Band of Maliseets, Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the \\nPenobscot Indian Nation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nshould contact Dr. Bruce Bourque, Chief Archaeologist, Maine State \\nMuseum, 83 State House Station, Augusta, ME 04333; telephone (207) 287-\\n2301, before July 21, 1997. Repatriation of the human remains to the \\nPassamaquoddy Tribe may begin after that date if no additional \\nclaimants come forward.\\nDated: June 12, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
