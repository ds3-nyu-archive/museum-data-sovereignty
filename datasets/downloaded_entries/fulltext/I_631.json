The human remains, along with objects, were discovered during road construction activities in northern Michigan and removed from the site by a University of Michigan archeology class. On September 9, 1991, the collections were donated from an estate to the Royal British Columbia Museum (RBCM) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The RBCM subsequently contacted the UMMAA and arranged a transfer. In November of 1991, the UMMAA accessioned the collections. The human remains are from an adult male. It is not known if the objects were associated with the human remains, or if they were recovered from the same site. However, they have been reported as associated funerary objects. The human remains are dated to the Middle Woodland Period (300 B.C\\xe2\\x80\\x94A.D. 500) based on the projectile points being reported as associated funerary objects. No known individuals were identified. The 4 associated funerary objects are 1 triangular-shaped stone celt and 3 corner-notched projectile points.\\n        On an unknown date prior to 1935, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown location in the State of Michigan, recorded as the GL-2048 site. The cranium of an adult female bearing the note \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian of Michigan, Dr. S. Lathrop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was identified in the holdings of the University of Michigan Department of Anatomy and transferred to the UMMAA in 1935. There are no records indicating how the UM Department of Anatomy acquired the cranium. The cranium has evidence of post-mortem modification, with two holes drilled on the vault, on the left and right parietals respectively, near Bregma. These post-mortem modifications are consistent with those found at the Younge (20LP1), Riviere aux Vase (20MB3), and Farmington I (20OK2) sites in Michigan. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from an unknown location in the State of Michigan, recorded as the GL-2053 site. During the 1930s, the UMMAA accessioned the fragmentary cranium and mandible fragment of a child. In September of 2014, UMMAA staff identified additional human remains from an adult that were also part of this accession. No further information is available. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from an unknown location in the State of Michigan, recorded as the GL-2091 site. The UMMAA collectively accessioned the fragmentary human remains of an adult male and a child. It is unknown whether these individuals were removed from the same location. No further information is available. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown location in the State of Michigan, recorded as the Unknown Mich.
