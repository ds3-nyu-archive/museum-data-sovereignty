The human remains were removed from site BJ 74 (LA 38962), Sandoval County, NM.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains.

Subsequent to the excavations, the human remains and other archeological materials were removed without notification to the Forest Service to Grinnell College, Grinnell, IA, for analysis and preparation of a site excavation report. In the summer of 2007, Grinnell College had the human remains and artifacts delivered to the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, who promptly notified the Forest Service of the existence of the collection. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Site BJ 74 (LA 38962) has been identified as an early historic Puebloan habitation site based on ceramics, architecture, and site organization. The site was occupied during the mid-16th century to the late 17th century A.D. Continuities of ethnographic materials, technologies, and architecture indicate the affiliation of this site with the present-day Pueblo of Jemez.
