In 1981, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) entered into a contract with Auburn University for a survey of the cultural resources on Seven Mile Island and adjacent Coffee Slough. This area is part of the Seven Mile Island Archeological District which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Natural erosion exacerbated by persistent looting raised questions regarding the condition of the sites on the island, which had not been professionally surveyed since the 1930s. Fieldwork took place from mid-December of 1981 to mid-April of 1982. Details regarding this survey may be found in a report, The Archaeology of Seven Mile Island: A Cultural Resource Survey of the National Register District, Volume 1 & 2, by Gregory A. Waselkov and Robert T. Morgan.\\n        Sometime after the fieldwork, TVA was notified that erosion and looting had exposed human remains along the shoreline of the island. At TVA\\'s request, archeologists from Auburn University removed these human remains and curated them at the University. Human remains representing one individual each were collected from the surface of sites 1LU15, 1LU18, 1LU114, 1LU276, and 1LU277. Human remains representing four individuals were excavated from an eroding shoreline of site 1LU275.
