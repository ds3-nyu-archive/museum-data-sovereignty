Petersen sold it to Mary and Francis Crane on February 19, 1976, and the Cranes donated it to the Denver Museum of Nature & Science on May 27, 1983. In the 1950s, Karen Petersen and her husband Sydney Petersen spent their summers visiting Anishinaabe communities, camping out and buying crafts from tribal members. When she was able to sell items, she sold them through churches in St. Paul, MN. She also collected Anishinaabe objects for the Science Museum of Minnesota as a staff member from 1958 to 1964.
