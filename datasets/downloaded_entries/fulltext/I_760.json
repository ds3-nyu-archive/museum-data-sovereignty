The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Pima County, AZ.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Arizona State Museum (ASM) professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1975, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Bechtel Burial site, AZ AA:12:98(ASM), in Pima County, AZ. The legally authorized excavation of an inadvertently discovered human burial was conducted by ASM under the direction of Valetta Reid. At the end of excavation, the archeological collection was brought to the museum and assigned an accession number. No known individuals were identified. The 39 associated artifacts are 1 chipped stone core, 17 chipped stone flakes, 1 chipped stone knife, 2 chipped stone scrapers, 1 mineral, 13 stone bifaces, and 4 stone projectile points. The objects in association with this individual have been interpreted by archaeologists as a toolkit for the manufacture of stone projectile points. The projectile points are classified as Sobaipuri or Upper Piman types, suggesting a chronological range of A.D. 1500 to 1800 for this burial.\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from private property at an unnamed site, AZ BB:13:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ramada, in Tucson, Pima County, AZ. The human remains were inadvertently found by Carl Harshman of the Hook Crane Service at the Ramada Inn while excavating a hole for a palm tree. The human remains and associated artifacts were brought to the museum and assigned an accession number. No known individuals were identified. The 17 associated funerary objects are 1 antler artifact, 1 bone artifact, 3 bone awls, 2 ceramic jars, 7 chipped stone flakes, 2 stone artifacts, and 1 stone projectile point preform. The archeological context of the discovery is unknown, but the artifact assemblage, especially including the ceramic types, suggests that the inhumation is likely from the proto-historical or historical period (A.D. 1450-1750). The assemblage has been interpreted by archeologists as including a flint-knapping toolkit.\\n        Ethnographic accounts of the Upper Piman inhabitants of Southern Arizona record that burials during the historical period were often accompanied by the decedent\\'s personal possessions. These notably included weaponry and toolkits for the manufacture of weaponry in the case of male burials. The term Piman was used by the Spanish to refer to the O\\'odham people, who are the present-day inhabitants of the region.\\n        In 1949, human remains representing, at minimum, 63 individuals were removed from Sections A and B of the San Agust\\xc3\\xacn de Tucson Mission site, AZ BB:13:6(ASM), in Tucson, Pima County, AZ. The legally authorized excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona under the direction of Terah L Smiley. The human remains and associated artifacts were collected prior to clay mining activities of the Tucson Pressed Brick Company. At the end of excavations, the archeological collections were brought ASM and assigned accession numbers. No known individuals were identified. The 13 associated funerary objects are 6 lots of glass beads, 2 metal artifacts, 3 metal crucifixes, 1 lot of shell beads, and 1 stone projectile point.\\n        AZ BB:13:6(ASM) is a multicomponent habitation and agricultural site. In the 1690s, Father Eusebio Kino traveled through southern Arizona and reported the presence of a Piman village on the west bank of the Santa Cruz River near Sentinel Peak. He named this village San Cosme de Tucson after Chuk-son, the Piman name for the village. By the early years of the 18th century, a visita was established at San Cosme as an extension of the mission of San Xavier del Bac, located a few miles to the south. Priests from San Xavier would come to the visita occasionally to conduct baptisms and other rites for the village inhabitants. Beginning in the early 1770\\'s construction began on more permanent facilities. The mission complex, renamed San Agust\\xc3\\xacn, eventually included a chapel, a two-story convent building, an orchard, a granary, and a cemetery for the Native American population. The mission was in use until the middle of the 19th century. Historical records indicate that Sections A and B of the cemetery were used for the interment of baptized Native Americans who were the inhabitants of the O\\'odham village. The O\\'odham people today are comprised of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Determinations Made by the Arizona State Museum\\n        Officials of the ASM have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 65 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 69 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to John McClelland, NAGPRA Coordinator, P.O.
