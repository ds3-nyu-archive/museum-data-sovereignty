Based on archeological evidence, \\ncontinuity of occupation, ethnographic accounts, and consultation with \\nrepresentatives of the Yurok Tribe of California, site CA-HUM-129 has \\nbeen affiliated with the present-day Yurok Tribe of California.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of Sonoma State \\nUniversity and the California Department of Parks and Recreation have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains \\nlisted above represent the physical remains of two individuals of \\nNative American ancestry. Officials of Sonoma State University and the \\nCalifornia Department of Parks and Recreation have determined also \\nthat, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared \\ngroup identity which can be reasonably traced between these Native \\nAmerican human remains and the Yurok Tribe of California.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Yurok Tribe of \\nCalifornia.
