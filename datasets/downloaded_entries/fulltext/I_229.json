Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology, Moscow, ID, and of associated funerary objects under the control of the Museum of the Rockies, Bozeman, MT. The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Park County, MT.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology and the Museum of the Rockies professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Blackfeet Tribe of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation of Montana; Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation; Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana; Nez Perce Tribe (previously listed as the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho); and Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana. The Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana (previously listed as the Chippewa-Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana); and Crow Tribe of Montana were invited to consult, but did not participate (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Invited and Consulted Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1929, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from a small cave in Park County, MT, by a private citizen. On November 1, 1988, the private citizen donated the human remains and objects to the Museum of the Rockies. Later that month, Carolyn A. Purcell, Museum of the Rockies Registrar, transferred the human remains to Dr. Roderick Sprague, Director of the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology. The associated funerary objects were retained by the Museum of the Rockies. The human remains consist of a right and left female innominate and a right male humerus. No known individuals were identified. The eight associated funerary objects are six flaked stone projectile points, one flaked stone drill or knife, and one digging stick of pine or spruce.\\n        At the time of the excavation and removal of these human remains and associated funerary objects, the land from which the remains and objects were removed was not the tribal land of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. In January 2018, Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology and Museum of the Rockies invited the Crow Tribe of Montana, who is recognized as aboriginal to the area from which these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed, to consult. The Crow Tribe of Montana did not participate in consultation and did not agree to accept control of the human remains and associated funerary objects. In April 2018, the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology and Museum of the Rockies agreed to transfer control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Blackfeet Tribe of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation of Montana; Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation; Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana; Nez Perce Tribe (previously listed as the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho); and Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana.\\n        Determinations Made by the Alfred W.
