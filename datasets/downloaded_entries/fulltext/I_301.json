The Wisconsin Historical Society conducted investigations at the site during a highway surface survey project that was part of a Wisconsin Department of Transportation Cooperative Agreement.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Between 1969 and 1989, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Krause Site (47-LC-0041) in La Crosse County, WI. The human remains were donated by the Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center (MVAC) in 1989 to the Wisconsin Burial Sites Preservation Office. MVAC reported the human remains as being collected over several years from different locations within the site. MVAC collected human remains in 1982 and again in 1989 during surface surveys of plowed fields, and additional human remains were donated to MVAC by local landowners and collectors who had collected human remains in 1969 and 1989. Skeletal analysis in 2015 determined that the human remains represent two individuals of indeterminate age and sex. No known individuals were identified.
