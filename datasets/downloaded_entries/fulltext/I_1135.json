The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Fowler Museum at UCLA professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona, has submitted a repatriation claim for the individual described in this notice, on behalf of itself and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Four Southern Tribes of Arizona\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1940, a human remain representing a minimum of one individual was removed from the Van Liere Ranch Site, in Maricopa County, AZ, during excavations by J.W. Simmons. The collection was donated to the Fowler Museum at UCLA by Thomas Hinton in 1956. The human remain is an infant\\'s tooth that was found in the collection. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Van Liere Ranch site was a burial ground with numerous Hohokam cremations and other features. This site is dated from A.D. 300-1500 based on the cultural materials found at the site, which are identified by archeologists and cultural experts as consistent with Hohokam culture. There are burial records that describe the excavation of each burial and include field and artifact photos, drawings, and site maps. Except for this individual, the human remains were not removed from the ground. Based on museum documentation and information during consultation, it is reasonable to believe this individual is Native American and of Hohokam ancestry.\\n        The Four Southern Tribes of Arizona assert a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclose relationship of shared group identity that can be traced both historically and prehistorically between the Four Southern Tribes of Arizona and the people that inhabited the south central Arizona and the northern region of present day Mexico from time immemorial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Therefore, The Four Southern Tribes of Arizona claim cultural affiliation to this individual based on geographical, archeological, linguistic, oral tradition, and historical evidence.\\n        The Hopi Tribe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclaims cultural and ancestral affiliation to all human remains, associated and unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony that were collected from Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Basketmaker, Hisatsinom (Anasazi), Mogollon, Hohokam, Sinaguan, Fremont, Mimbres, and Salado, prehistoric and historic cultures of the Southwest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        Based on, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cZuni oral teachings and tradition, ethnohistoric documentation, historic documentation, archaeological documentation, and other evidence, the Zuni Tribe claims cultural affiliation with prehistoric cultures of the Southwestern United States that include, and are known as, Paleo Indian, Archaic, Basketmaker, Puebloan, Freemont, Anasazi, Mogollon (including Mimbres and Jornada), Hohokam, Sinagua, Western Pueblo, and Salado.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        Therefore, the oral tradition, kinship system, and archeology all indicate that The Four Southern Tribes of Arizona, Hopi Tribe of Arizona, and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, identify with the archeological Hohokam tradition. Finally, multiple lines of evidence, including treaties, Acts of Congress, and Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remain was removed is the aboriginal land of The Four Southern Tribes of Arizona, Hopi Tribe of Arizona, and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Determinations Made by the Fowler Museum at UCLA\\n        Officials of the Fowler Museum at UCLA have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remain described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remain and The Four Southern Tribes of Arizona, Hopi Tribe of Arizona, and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remain should contact Wendy G.
