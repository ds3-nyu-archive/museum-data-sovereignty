Goddard collected these cultural items on the San \\nCarlos Apache Reservation on behalf of the American Museum of Natural \\nHistory. The Museum accessioned them into its collection the same year \\n(AMNH accession 1914-53).\\n    The cultural affiliation of these items is San Carlos Apache as \\nindicated through Museum records and consultation with representatives \\nof the San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation. \\nConsultation\\n\\n[[Page 10407]]\\n\\nevidence presented by representatives of the San Carlos Apache Tribe of \\nthe San Carlos Reservation indicates these items have ongoing \\nhistorical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the tribe \\nitself, and no individual had the right to alienate them. The Museum\\'s \\nreview of this information indicates it is accurate.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the American \\nMuseum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(4), these eight cultural items have ongoing historical, \\ntraditional, and cultural importance central to the tribe itself, and \\ncould not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any \\nindividual. Officials of the American Museum of Natural History have \\nalso determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these items and the San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos \\nReservation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the San Carlos Apache \\nTribe of the San Carlos Reservation, the White Mountain Apache Tribe of \\nthe Fort Apache Reservation, the Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona, the \\nYavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Reservation, and the Fort \\nMcDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community of the Fort McDowell Indian \\nReservation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes \\nitself to be culturally affiliated with these objects should contact \\nMartha Graham, Registrar of Cultural Resources, American Museum of \\nNatural History, Department of Anthropology, Central Park West at 79th \\nStreet, New York, NY 10024-5192; telephone (212) 769-5846 before April \\n2, 1998. Repatriation of these objects to the San Carlos Apache Tribe \\nof the San Carlos Reservation may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: February 26, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
