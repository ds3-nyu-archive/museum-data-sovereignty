In 1953, this cultural item was sent to the University of Alaska Museum from the University of Pennsylvania Museum as part of an exchange collection. The human remains recovered with this cultural item have previously been repatriated from the University of Pennsylvania. \\n        Based on material culture, the Cotton Wood Creek site has been identified as Kachemak Bay period (c. 1500 A.D.) Chugach occupations. \\n\\n        Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the University of Alaska Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), this one cultural item is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of the University of Alaska Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between this item and the Chugach Alaska Corporation. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Chugach Alaska Corporation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this object should contact Gary Selinger, Special Projects Manager, University of Alaska Museum, 907 Yukon Drive, Fairbanks, AK 99775-1200; telephone: (907) 474-6117, fax: (907) 474-5469 before May 1, 2000. Repatriation of this object to the Chugach Alaska Corporation may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: March 23, 2000. \\n          Francis P.
