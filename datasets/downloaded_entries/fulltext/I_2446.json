No known individuals were identified. The \\nthree associated funerary objects include three strings of olivella \\nshell disk beads.\\n    Accession documentation describes the remains and associated \\nfunerary objects as, ``Material from the ranch of J.C. Turner, in sandy \\nMohave Riverbed 12 miles north of Victorville. Combination village and \\nburial site.\\'\\' The human remains and associated funerary objects are \\ndated to A.D. 1690-1770, based on the presence of incised olivella wall \\nbeads. A representative of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has \\nconfirmed that the Turner Ranch site lies within traditional Serrano \\nlands and is an historic Serrano village.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Los \\nAngeles County Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the \\nphysical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry. \\nOfficials of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), that the three \\nstrings of olivella beads listed above are reasonably believed to have \\nbeen placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death \\nor later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of \\nthe Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History have determined that, \\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these Native American \\nhuman remains and associated funerary objects and the San Manuel Band \\nof Mission Indians.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the San Manuel Band of \\nMission Indians. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Dr. Margaret Ann Hardin, \\nCurator and Section Head, Anthropology, the Los Angeles County Museum \\nof Natural History, 900 Exposition Blvd., Los Angeles, CA; telephone: \\n(213) 744-3382, before [thirty days after publication in the Federal \\nRegister]. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects to the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: May 22, 1996\\nFrancis P.
