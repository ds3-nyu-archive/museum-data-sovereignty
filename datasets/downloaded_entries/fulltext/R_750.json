No records or information exists indicating \\nhow the Repository acquired these items, although it is presumed they \\nwere donations.\\n    On the basis of stylistic characteristics, these cultural items \\nhave been identified as Hopi in origin. Consultations with traditional \\nreligious leaders and representatives of the Hopi Tribe and traditional \\nreligious leaders and representatives of the Pueblo of Jemez confirm \\nthe cultural affiliations of these cultural items as Hopi. The \\nRepository contacted personnel at the Arizona State Museum, who \\nidentified the two tablitas as having been used in the Niman ceremony. \\nRepresentatives of the Hopi Tribe and Hopi traditional religious \\nleaders have identified these four cultural items as needed by Native \\nAmerican traditional religious leaders for the practice of traditional \\nNative American religion by present-day adherents.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the \\nUniversity of California-Santa Barbara have determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(3), these four cultural items are specific \\nceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious \\nleaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by \\ntheir present-day adherents. Officials of the University of California-\\nSanta Barbara have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), \\nthere is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these items and the Hopi Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hopi Tribe and the \\nPueblo of Jemez. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these objects should \\ncontact Nancy A. Doner, NAGPRA Coordinator, Office of Research, \\nUniversity of California-Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106; \\ntelephone (805) 893-4180 before February 19, 1999. Repatriation of \\nthese objects to the Hopi Tribe may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: January 7, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
