The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In 1944, Mrs. Frank Applegate donated two kachina masks (IAF.C220 and IAF.C221) and one stone axe with a wooden handle (IAF.C243) to the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center. According to documentation, the two masks and the axe belonged to the Jemez Warrior Society at the Pueblo of Jemez. The School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center has no documentation on how Mrs. Applegate came to own the items.\\n        In 1958, Roy Tilghman donated one round mask (IAF.C282) to the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center. According to documentation, the mask is from the Pueblo of Jemez. The School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center has no documentation on how Mr. Tilghman came to own the item.\\n        The four cultural items have each been identified as both sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony. Pueblo of Jemez representatives have visited the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center on several occasions (including three visits during the years 2008 to 2010) to view many items, including the three kachina masks and the stone axe listed in this notice. The review of the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center\\'s documentation, in addition to physical inspections by Pueblo of Jemez representatives, has resulted in confirmation from the Pueblo of Jemez\\'s traditional leaders that the four items are of Pueblo of Jemez origin, supporting cultural affiliation, as well as determining that the four items meet the criteria for both sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony. The School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center records, including catalog cards and other provenance information, indicate these objects to be of Pueblo of Jemez origin, further supporting the claim by the Pueblo of Jemez. On December 24, 2014, the Pueblo of Jemez submitted a repatriation request from the Governor for three of the sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony (IAF.C220, IAF.C221, and IAF.C282, the three kachina masks). On February 19, 2015, the Pueblo of Jemez submitted a repatriation request from the Tribal Cultural Properties Project Manager for the fourth sacred object and object of cultural patrimony (IAF.C243, the stone axe).\\n        Determinations Made by the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center\\n        Officials of the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the 4 cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the 4 cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Brian Vallo, Director, School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center, P.O.
