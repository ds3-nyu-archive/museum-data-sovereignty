The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Burke Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and the Nez Perce Tribe, Idaho (hereinafter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

In 1974, the Burke Museum legally transferred portions of the human remains to Central Washington University. In 2007, a Notice of Inventory Completion (NIC) describing 4 individuals and 42 associated funerary objects removed from the Cedar Cave site was published in the Federal Register [72 FR 52391-52392, September 13, 2007]. The Burke Museum and Central Washington University have jointly repatriated these human remains and funerary objects from the Cedar Cave site described in the NIC. In 2009, during a collection cataloging and rehousing project, the Burke Museum located one human tooth, representing an additional individual, which had also been removed from the Cedar Cave Site. No known individual was identified. There are no associated funerary objects for this individual.\\n        Early and late published ethnographic documentation indicates that the Cedar Cave Site is in the aboriginal territory of the Moses-Columbia or Sinkiuse, and the Yakima (Daugherty 1973, Miller 1998, Mooney 1896, Ray 1936, Spier 1936) whose descendants are represented today by the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington, and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington. Furthermore, information provided during consultation indicates that the aboriginal ancestors occupying this area were highly mobile and traveled the landscape for gathering resources as well as trade.
