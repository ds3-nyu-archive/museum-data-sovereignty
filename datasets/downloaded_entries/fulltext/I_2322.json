No known individuals were identified. No associated \\nfunerary objects are present.\\n    In 1972, human remains representing five individuals were recovered \\nfrom an eroding area of the west bank of the Snake River at Farewell \\nBend, Malheur County by officers from the Malheur County Sheriff\\'s \\nOffice and transferred to the OSMA. No known individuals were \\nidentified. The one associated funerary object is a basalt flake.\\n    Based on skeletal morphology and archeological context, the \\nindividuals from the two sites above have been identified as Native \\nAmerican. Historical documents, ethnographic sources, and oral history \\nindicate that Cayuse people have occupied this north-eastern area of \\nOregon surrounding these two sites since precontact times. The Cayuse \\nare one of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation.\\n    In 1965, human remains representing two individuals were recovered \\nfrom site 35UM35, within the town of Umatilla, OR during legally \\nauthorized excavations conducted by University of Oregon archeologists. \\nNo known individuals were identified. The approximately five associated \\nfunerary objects include one pounder, a piece of quartzite, bones of a \\ngray fox, fragments of mussel shell, and unworked flakes.\\n\\n[[Page 63946]]\\n\\n    In 1985, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nalong the Pendleton-John Day Highway on the north bank of Granite \\nCreek, Umatilla County, OR by an Oregon Department of Transportation \\nconstruction crew. No known individual was identified. No associated \\nfunerary objects are present.\\n    Based on skeletal morphology and archeological context, the \\nindividuals from the two sites above have been identified as Native \\nAmerican. Historical documents, ethnographic sources, and oral history \\nindicate that Umatilla people have occupied this north-eastern area of \\nOregon surrounding these two sites since precontact times. The Umatilla \\nare one of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Oregon \\nState Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical \\nremains of ten individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of \\nthe Oregon State Museum of Anthropology have also determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the three objects listed above are \\nreasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human \\nremains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or \\nceremony. Lastly, officials of the Oregon State Museum of Anthropology \\nhave determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Confederated Tribes \\nof the Umatilla Reservation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe \\nthat believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects should contact C. Melvin \\nAikens, Oregon State Museum of Anthropology, 1224 University of Oregon, \\nEugene, OR 97403-1224; telephone: (541) 346-5115, before December 17, \\n1998.
