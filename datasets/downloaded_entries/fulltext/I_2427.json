Bruce and recieved by the Field Museum. One individual was \\nremoved from Grantley Harbor, AK, and the second individual was removed \\nfrom Port Clarence, AK. No known individuals were identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects are present.\\n    Around 1898, human remains representing one individual were \\nrecieved from Miner H. Bruce by the Field Museum. This individual was a \\nnative woman from Port Clarence, AK who died at the Cook County \\nHospital, Chicago, IL. No known individual was identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects are present.\\n    Accession records state these three individuals are from Grantley \\nHarbor and Port Clarence, AK.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Field \\nMuseum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the \\nField Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), \\nthere is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the \\nNative Village of Teller.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Native Village of \\nTeller, the Teller Native Corporation, and the Bering Straits \\nFoundation.
