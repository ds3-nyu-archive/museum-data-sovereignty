The landowner contacted the Michigan Archaeological Society and they reached an agreement to spend one month salvaging the site. Those individuals excavating the site encountered a total of eight burial pits with large red ochre deposits. The burial pits contained human remains exhibiting various mortuary treatments, including secondary inhumation, probable primary burial, and cremation. One burial pit (Feature 8) was pedestalled, removed in large blocks, and stored at a private residence for later disaggregation in a controlled laboratory setting. In 1995, the human remains were transferred from the private residence to the University of Michigan, where they were accessioned into the Museum of Anthropology. Between 2007 and 2009 the remains were inventoried at the University of Michigan and those remains from Feature 8 were excavated from the red ochre soil matrix that had been pedestalled and removed from the Site. Human remains representing a minimum of 120 individuals were recorded from the eight burial pits. No known individuals were identified. The 219 objects recovered from the burial site are: 1 Stone abrader, 64 faunal bones, 45 fragments of charcoal, 8 eroded daub fragments, 8 pieces of fire cracked rock, 76 chert flakes, 2 grit-tempered ceramic sherds, 7 jars of soil, 5 red ochre samples, and 3 unworked shell fragments.\\n        The Fisher Site is dated to the Late Archaic period (2250-850 B.C.) based on funerary practices and the extensive use of red ochre in the burial puts.
