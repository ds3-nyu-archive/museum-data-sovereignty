The human remains were transferred in April 1990 to the Kansas State Historical Society by the Wallingford Historical Society of Wallingford, Connecticut. The Wallingford Historical Society acquired the human remains as a donation from Harold Stearns. Stearns had received the human remains around 1917 as a gift from George Remsburg, a well-known collector of Indian artifacts in the early 20th century. These human remains are identified by the designation UBS 1989-19B. No known individuals were identified.

The human remains are therefore interpreted as being affiliated with the Kaw Nation.\\n        In 1987, human remains representing, at minimum, five individuals were removed from the Doniphan site, 14DP2, in Doniphan County, KS, and designated UBS 1990-28. These human remains were exposed by erosion and excavated by Kansas State Historical staff, done with the agreement of Bill Mehojah, then Chairman of the Kaw Tribe of Oklahoma. No known individuals were identified. There are 132 associated funerary objects: 1 Ceramic vessel, 18 beads, 1 pipe, 1 tablet, 2 Catlinite pieces, 1 bone awl, 1 bivalve shell, 1 gunflint, 1 projectile point, 35 pottery sherds, 71 flakes, 1 peach seed, 1 vial of squash seeds, 9 black seeds, daub, 2 cinders, charcoal, 1 sack of fibers, 1 geode, 1 crockery sherd, 2 abraders, both broken; and 1 vial rodent bones.\\n        In 1936, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Doniphan site in Doniphan County, KS, by A.T.

The human remains consist of an adult cranium. The human remains were first taken to Atchison County Historical Society, and then further transferred to Kansas State Historical Society and designated UBS 1991-104. The human remains were then sent to Kansas State University for analysis, and were returned to the Kansas State Historical Society in 1998. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In or around 1949, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were found on the Ford farm, presumably the Doniphan site, in Doniphan County, KS. A note with the human remains states that they were found exposed. The human remains were originally in the collections of Benedictine College in Atchison, KS. They were transferred to the Kansas State Historical Society in 1992, designated UBS 1992-24-6 (24A) and analyzed by physical anthropologist Dr. Michael Finnegan in 1997. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Blue Earth Village site, site 14PO24, in Pottawatomie County, KS.
