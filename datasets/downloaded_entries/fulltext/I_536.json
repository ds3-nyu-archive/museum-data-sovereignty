Several small skeletal elements were collected from the surface of the mounds during an archeological survey. These human remains were transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program. The human remains were identified as one juvenile and one adult, both of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Blood Run National Historic Landmark, site number 13LO2, in Lyon County, IA. The human remains were part of the Amy Harvey collection. Amy Harvey collected Oneota materials while doing doctoral research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the early 1960s, and retained the materials when she began teaching at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, in 1965. The human remains were transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program in 2010. The human remains were identified as one subadult, approximately two years old, and one adult. Sex could not be determined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Blood Run National Historic Landmark (site 13LO2) is a large Oneota tradition village site located in Iowa and South Dakota, straddling the Big Sioux River southeast of Sioux Falls, SD. Archeological evidence, including radiocarbon dates and trade artifacts, suggests that the site was most intensively occupied from A.D. 1500-1700. Tribal histories, supported by French historical maps and documents, strongly suggest that the Omaha (possibly including the Ponca at this time), Iowa, and Oto tribes were present in the area at that time and were the probable residents of the site. The Ho-Chunk and Winnebago are also ethnohistorically linked to these tribes. Based on this contextual information, it has been determined that there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.\\n        Determinations Made by the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program\\n        Officials of the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Lara Noldner, Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program, University of Iowa, 700 South Clinton Street, Iowa City, IA 52242, telephone (319) 384-0740, email lara-noldner@uiowa.edu, by July 14, 2016.
