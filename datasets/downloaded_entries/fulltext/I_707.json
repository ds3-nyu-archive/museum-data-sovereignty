The site was discovered and partially excavated by private citizens. They subsequently contacted Professor William Buckles of Southern Colorado State College (now Colorado State University-Pueblo) who completed their removal. In 1999, the remains were delivered to History Colorado after the closure of the Laboratory of Anthropology at the College. The burial was located in a cleft in rocks in a shallow pit lacking significant deposits above it. The burial was near the confluence of Rush Creek and the Arkansas River. Osteological analysis determined that the remains are of an adult female of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. The four associated funerary objects are one lot of fragments of a woven bag, one piece of braided yucca, one flake and one drill bit tip.\\n\\n        Based on expert opinion, archeological, geographical and historical evidence, and oral tradition, there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah. Expert opinion of Dr. Buckles concluded that the site where the remains originated most likely dated to the historic period based on the condition of the remains and funerary objects and that it was consistent with Ute burial practices in which the deceased were often placed in clefts in rock. Description of traditional Ute burial practices provided by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah confirm that the individual\\'s burial was consistent with Ute burial practices. The burial was located in the ancestral territory of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah. Oral tradition and historical documents cited by the Ute Tribes indicate Moache, Capute and Weenuche bands used the area where the remains were discovered on seasonal rounds and for trading and raiding. Descendants from these bands now reside on the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Reservations. Funerary objects are consistent with Ute culture.\\n        Determinations Made by History Colorado\\n        Officials of History Colorado have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the four objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado and Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Sheila Goff, History Colorado, 1200 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203, telephone (303) 866-4531, email Sheila.goff@state.co.us, by March 6, 2015.
