The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Field Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with professional staff of the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository, Kodiak, AK, on behalf of Akhiok-Kaguyak, Inc.; Kaguyak Village; Koniag, Inc.; and Native Village of Akhiok.\\n\\n        In 1950, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the the Alitak Bay side of the Aliulik Peninsula, Kodiak Island, AK, by Arthur Freeman, who donated them to the Field Museum of Natural History in 1983 (Field Museum of Natural History accession number 3566, catalog number 242601).
