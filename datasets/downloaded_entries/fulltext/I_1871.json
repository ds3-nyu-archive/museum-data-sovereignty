Descendants of the two bands are known to be members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington and Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho. The Asotin cemetery site is located within the area reserved by the Nez Perce under the Treaty of 1855, but was deleted from tribal lands in the Treaty of 1863.
