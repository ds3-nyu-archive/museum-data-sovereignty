The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item(s)\\n        In 1958 and 1959, three cultural items were removed from CA-SDI-525 (W-9) in San Diego County, CA. Carl L. Hubbs, G. Shumway, J. Moriarity, and Claude Warren conducted excavations during the construction of two homes on Scripps Estate Association Lots. The site was dated to the Middle Holocene (between 7,000 and 5,500 B.P.) based on radiocarbon dating. In 1959, the collections were sent to UCLA for curation. 16 burials were uncovered, of which seven were left in situ, two burials (9 and 10) were supposedly sent to UCLA, and the rest were curated with J.R. Moriarty, UC Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Burials 9 and 10 cannot currently be located, although they are reported to have been sent to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStanford\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for dating and despite extensive investigations. Funerary objects were identified in the collections as being removed from these two burials. There were three objects including one stone metate, one shell fragment, and one soil sample. Since the represented burials have not been located these burial items are eligible as NAGPRA unassociated funerary objects.\\n\\n        The site detailed in the paragraphs preceding has been identified through consultation to be within the aboriginal territory of the Kumeyaay people. Based on archeological evidence, geographic location, ethnographic information, and oral history evidence, these funerary objects are consistent with those of ancestral Kumeyaay people, represented by the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California (Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, California; Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California); Ewiiaapaayp Band of Kumeyaay Indians, California; Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel, California (previously listed as the Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation); Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; and Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        Determinations Made by the Fowler Museum at UCLA\\n        Officials of the Fowler Museum at UCLA have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the three cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Wendy G.
