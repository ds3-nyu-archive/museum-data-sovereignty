(ACT) under contract with Time for Living, Inc. ACT stored these cultural items until 1998, when collections including these cultural items were donated to the San Diego Archaeological Center, San Diego, CA. The human remains recovered with these cultural items were repatriated to the Cuyapaipe Community of Degueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation in 1973. \\n        Based on geographic location and archeological evidence, the Santee Greens site has been identified as a Kumeyaay village site dating to the Late Archaic period (c. 760-1030 A.D.). Based on site information, excavation records, and manner of interment, these cultural items have been identified as unassociated funerary objects. Archeological literature and continuity of occupation indicates cultural affiliation with the Kumeyaay tribes. \\n        Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the San Diego Archaeological Center have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(d)(2)(ii), these 11 cultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of the San Diego Archaeological Center have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Reservation, the Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California, the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, the Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, the Cuyapaipe Community of Degueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, the Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, the La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Reservation, the Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, the Jamul Indian Village, the Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, the San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California, the Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, and the Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Reservation, the Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California, the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, the Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, the Cuyapaipe Community of Degueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, the Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, the La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Reservation, the Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, the Jamul Indian Village, the Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, the San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California, the Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, and the Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California.
