Prior to the excavation, the private property owner had performed extensive earthmoving on his property, primarily cutting and grading to obtain fill materials. During subsequent cutwork, the property owner encountered bone, and removed a human cranium from the site. The Jackson Post of the Michigan State Police was contacted on September 20, 1978, and an investigative team visited the property. When human materials were identified as prehistoric, Dr. Saur at Michigan State University (MSU) was contacted. A team of MSU archeologists excavated the site and, upon completion of the project, the MSUM curated the human remains.\\n        Four individual burials were identified. Individual 1 was a virtually complete, flexed burial and was identified as a mid-adult female. Individual 2 was a virtually complete, except for arms and legs, extended burial and was identified as a late-adult female. Individual 3 was a fragmented burial identified as an adult male. Individual 4 was a fragmented burial identified as a young-adult male. The remaining human remains, representing at minimum six additional individuals, included a cranial piece, four ribs, five long bone fragments, four tarsal fragments, and numerous other unidentifiable bone fragments. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The human remains date to the Late Prehistoric era based on the structure of the mortuary domain being consistent with burial practices.\\n        Determinations Made by the Michigan State University Museum\\n        Officials of the MSUM have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American, based on age and burial practices.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 10 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Federal Claims, the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana and the Grand River Band of Odawa Indians (GRBOI), a non-Federally recognized Indian group.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana and the Grand River Band of Odawa Indians (GRBOI), a non-Federally recognized Indian group.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Jaclyn Lillis-Warwick, MSUM, 409 West Circle Drive, East Lansing, MI 48824, telephone (517) 432-4339, email lillisja@msu.edu, by October 30, 2013.
