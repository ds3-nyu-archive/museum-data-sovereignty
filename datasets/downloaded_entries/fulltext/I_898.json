A landowner unearthed human remains while digging a gas line trench on his property. He contacted D.B. Cochran of the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology (UMMA) who collected the remains of one cremated adult, one adolescent, and one child from the fill soil of the trench. Cochran also surveyed the general area, including both sides of the North Branch Thornapple River, for additional burials or artifacts, but found none. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In the 1930s, human remains representing, at minimum, 1 individual were removed from the Yankee Springs site in Barry County, MI. Workers unearthed the remains of one adult male during gravel pit operations. An employee of the State of Michigan working at the Yankee Springs Recreational Area collected the remains. The skull was eventually donated to the UMMA in the 1960s. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In either 1905 or 1906, human remains representing, at minimum, 2 individuals were removed from the Burch site (20BR1) in Branch County, MI. A landowner found and collected an unknown number of human remains and associated funerary objects while digging on his farm. On an unknown date, he transferred one cranium and three long bones from a young adult female to a Professor of Archaeology at Ohio State University and member of the Ohio Historical Society who subsequently donated these remains to the UMMA in 1955. Additionally, the landowner\\'s nephew transferred one cranium from an adult male, along with an unknown number of the associated funerary objects, to a local collector who subsequently donated the cranium and 148 associated funerary objects to the UMMA in 1970. The human remains likely date to the Late Archaic-Early Woodland Period (2550-300 B.C.) and are likely associated with the Glacial Kame cultural complex as inferred from the presence of sandal-sole gorgets made from Busycon shell. No known individuals were identified. The 148 associated funerary objects present are 17 copper beads, 114 shell disk beads, 1 copper awl, 3 round shell gorgets perforated at the center, 6 large sandal-sole gorgets with perforations, 2 curved triangular shell gorgets with perforations, 4 oblong shell gorgets, and 1 copper gorget.\\n        In 1924, human remains representing, at minimum, 1 individual were removed from the Enos Short\\'s Farm site (20CA102) in Calhoun County, MI. A farmer collected the remains of one young adult female while removing gravel on farmland near Battle Creek, MI. The individual was buried with her head toward the north and facing to the east. The farmer donated the human remains to the UMMA in September of 1924. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date prior to 1975, human remains representing, at a minimum, 1 adult individual were removed from the Stony Creek site (20IA44) in Ionia County, MI. A local resident collected the human remains, along with an unspecified number of greywacke and quartzite artifacts of unknown type, from a location near Stony Creek. The artifacts were not donated to the UMMA. The artifacts are typical of the Late Archaic Satchell Complex and, along with the presence of copper salt residues on the human remains, help date the human remains to the Archaic Period. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, 1 individual were removed from the Kent County site in Kent County, MI. Amateur archeologists collected one mandible from a location along the Grand River near the Norton Mounds. It is unclear when the human remains were actually donated to the UMMA, but museum records indicate that the mandible was placed in the teaching collection in 1967. Green staining was noted on the mandible. The human remains date to the Pre-Contact Period based on the presence of numerous documented sites from this period in the same area. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In July 1930, human remains representing, at minimum, 9 individuals were removed from the West Side of Flat River site (20KT43) in Kent County, MI. A local resident collected the remains of eight adults and one child, and donated them to the UMMA on December 29, 1930. The site has multiple components and may have burials that date to both the Pre-Contact and Post-Contact Periods. Historical records indicate that the area where the burials were discovered was known to contain a mound from the Pre-Contact Period as well as a Native American burial ground from the Post-Contact Period likely associated with the Odawa leader Keweyooshcum, who had a village located in the vicinity. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        \\n        Determinations Made by the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology\\n        Officials of the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on cranial morphology, dental traits, accession documentation, and archeological context.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 18 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 148 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Federal Claims, the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects may be to The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Ben Secunda, NAGPRA Project Manager, University of Michigan, Office of the Vice President for Research, 4080 Fleming Building, 503 Thompson St., Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1340, telephone (734) 647-9085, email bsecunda@umich.edu, by December 2, 2013.

The site has multiple components and may have burials that date to both the Pre-Contact and Post-Contact Periods. Historical records indicate that the area where the burials were discovered was known to contain a mound from the Pre-Contact Period as well as a Native American burial ground from the Post-Contact Period likely associated with the Odawa leader Keweyooshcum, who had a village located in the vicinity. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No individuals were identified.
