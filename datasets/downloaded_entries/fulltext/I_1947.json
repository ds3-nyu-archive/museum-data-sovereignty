No associated funerary objects are present. \\n         In 1912, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were collected by Vilhajlmur Stefansson from Birnirk, three miles northeast of Barrow, North Slope Borough, AK, during an American Museum of Natural History expedition.  No known individual was identified.  No associated funerary objects are present. \\n         These individuals have been identified as Native American based on geographic information and documentation at the American Museum of Natural History.  Consultation with tribal representatives, geographic location, and documentation at the American Museum of Natural History suggest that a relationship exists between contemporary inhabitants of the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government and these human remains from Point Barrow, AK, and Birnirk, AK. \\n         Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the American Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 122 individuals of Native American ancestry.  Officials of the American Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government and Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation.\\n\\n         This notice has been sent to officials of the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government and Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation.
