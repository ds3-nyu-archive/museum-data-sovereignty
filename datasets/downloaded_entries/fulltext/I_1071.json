The human remains were removed from Grays Harbor County, WA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Central Washington University Department of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In November 1947, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site 45-GH-15 (Minard) in Grays Harbor County, WA, by archeologist Richard Daugherty of the University of Washington during his systematic archeological survey of the Washington coast. Richard Daugherty noted that the property owner had inadvertently uncovered at least 27 human skeletons while plowing his fields. According to the Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum (Burke Museum) accession ledger, Daugherty collected two femora and one humerus. The collection was formally accessioned by the Burke Museum in 1947 (Burke Accn. #3583). In 1974, the Burke Museum legally transferred the right humerus and left femur to Central Washington University Department of Anthropology (CWU ID BA).\\n\\n        The bones were examined by physical anthropologist Lourdes Henebry-DeLeon of Central Washington University, and the skeletal remains, which consist of a humerus and femur, cannot be used to establish conclusively cultural affiliation. However, the human remains have markings of 19-15(1) (right humerus) and 19-15(2) (left femur) written on them indicating the collecting location. Burke Museum records show 19-15 is the catalog number associated with site 45-GH-15. Based on the markings on the remains, the records at the Burke Museum and Richard Daugherty\\'s survey records it is reasonably believed that these remains are from site 45-GH-15. There have been other Notices of Inventory Completion (NICs) published in the Federal Register for site 45-GH-15 (72 FR 27845-27846, May 17, 2007, and 73 FR 49484-49485, August 21, 2008). The materials reported in the earlier NICs were culturally affiliated with the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington. Based on archeological context and the platymeric femoral morphology, the individual has been determined to be Native American. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Site 45-GH-15 is located at or near the traditional Copalis village of Oyhut. The Copalis are considered to have been a band of the Lower Chehalis whose traditional territory encompassed the lower reaches of the Chehalis River and the present-day county of Grays Harbor, WA. The site is located within the area identified by the Indian Claims Commission as the aboriginal territory of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington.
