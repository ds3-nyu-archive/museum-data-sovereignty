No known individuals were identified. The eleven associated \\nfunerary objects include pieces of brass, copper, iron, hematite; \\nfragments of wood, cloth, glass; and soil samples from burial matrices.\\n    The five cultural items are a small ceramic pot, a necklace of \\nshell and glass beads, a necklace of small blue trade beads, cloth \\nfragments, and soil samples from unidentified burials.\\n    Based on oral tradition, types of associated funerary objects, and \\nhistorical documents, these individuals have been identified as Native \\nAmerican. Based on the trade objects and historical documentation of \\nthis site, these burials are estimated to date to the eighteenth \\ncentury, c. 1727-1777 A.D. Records indicate the five cultural items \\nwere recovered from burials, however, the human remains with these \\nobjects cannot be identified. Oral tradition and historical \\ndocumentation further indicate this site was a village site of the \\nMissouria during the eighteenth century.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nUniversity of Missouri-Columbia have determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical \\nremains of a minimum of six individuals of Native American ancestry. \\nOfficials of the University of Missouri-Columbia have also determined \\nthat, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the eleven objects listed above \\nare reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual \\nhuman remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite \\nor ceremony. Officials of the University of Missouri-Columbia have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these five \\ncultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near \\nindividual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the \\ndeath rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the \\nevidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native \\nAmerican individual. Lastly, officials of the University of Missouri-\\nColumbia have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains, associated funerary \\nobjects, and unassociated funerary objects and the the Otoe-Missouria \\nTribe of Indians.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Iowa Tribe of \\nOklahoma, the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, and the Otoe-Missouria \\nTribe of Indians. Representatives of any other Indian Tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Dr. Michael J. O\\'Brien, \\nDirector, Museum of Anthropology, 317 Lowry Hall, University of \\nMissouri, Columbia, MO 65211; telephone: (573) 882-4421, before April \\n15, 1999. Repatriation of the human remains, associated funerary \\nobjects, and unassociated funerary objects to the Iowa Tribe of \\nOklahoma on behalf and as authorized representatives of the Otoe-\\nMissouria Tribe of Indians may begin after that date if no additional \\nclaimants come forward.\\nDated: March 9, 1999.\\nVeletta Canouts,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nDeputy Manager, Archeology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 99-6307 Filed 3-15-99; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
