The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from known and unknown locations in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. \\n\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n\\n        This notice corrects the number of associated funerary objects from 345 to 451, and the minimum number of individuals from 361 to 373, in a Notice of Inventory Completion published in the Federal Register (69 FR 68162-68169, November 23, 2004).\\n        In the Federal Register of November 23, 2004, at page 68163, paragraph number 2 is corrected by the addition of one associated funerary object, and by substituting the following paragraph: \\n        Prior to 1890, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed by Richard Wetherill, Al Wetherill, and Charlie Mason from unidentified sites in the Mesa Verde area, Montezuma County, CO. The human remains (O.701.1, O.2249.1) were initially sold to Charles McLoyd, who sold the collection to the Colorado Historical Society in 1890. No known individuals were identified. One associated funerary object, O.247.1, a black-on-white ceramic plate, is present. Cranial morphology is consistent with physical features common to Ancient Puebloan populations. Ancient Puebloan occupation of the Mesa Verde area dates from approximately 1000 B.C. to A.D. 1300.\\n        In the Federal Register of November 23, 2004, at page 68163, paragraph number 6 is corrected by deleting one individual and two associated funerary objects, and by substituting the following paragraph: \\n        Prior to 1892, human remains representing a minimum of 21 individuals were removed by either Arthur Wilmarth or Al and Richard Wetherill from the Mesa Verde area in Montezuma County, CO. The human remains (O.680.1, O.683.1, O.690.1, O.713.1, O.715.1, O.721.1, O.722.1, O.1731.1, O.1733.2, O.1734.1, O.1735.1, O.1736.1, O.1741.1, O.735.1, O.673.1, O.674.1, O.676.1, O.2252.1, O.2267.1, O.6017.1, UHR.171) were accessioned by the Colorado Historical Society in 1892. The 10 associated funerary objects (O.432.1, O.285.1, O.1733.3, O.1733.1, O.1729.1, O.1736.1.b, O.188.2, O.1741.1.b, O.7405.45, O.935.1) are a black-on-white ceramic mug, two black-on-white ceramic bowls, a black-on-white ceramic pitcher, a cotton shirt, a buckskin shirt, a feather blanket, and three single sandals. The original provenience within the Mesa Verde region from which these human remains were removed is unknown. Arthur Wilmarth, Al and Richard Wetherill and D.W. Ayers excavated numerous sites in the Mesa Verde area (including Tower House, Balcony House, Cliff Palace, Mug House, Mummy House, Step House, and Spruce Tree House) at different times. Items recovered from earlier excavations led by the Wetherills were sold to Charles McLoyd, who sold the collection to the Colorado Historical Society in 1890. Later excavations led by Arthur Wilmarth were funded by the Colorado State Legislature and items from the excavations were displayed at the Columbian Exposition at the Chicago World\\'s Fair in 1893. These items were transferred to the Colorado Historical Society later the same year. Cranial morphology is consistent with physical features common to Ancient Puebloan populations. Ancient Puebloan occupation of the Mesa Verde area generally dates from approximately 1000 B.C. to A.D. 1300.\\n        In the Federal Register of November 23, 2004, at page 68164, paragraph number 2 is corrected by deleting one associated funerary ojbect, and by substituting the following paragraph: \\n        Prior to 1893, human remains representing a minimum of four individuals were removed by either Arthur Wilmarth or Al and Richard Wetherill from Mummy House (5MV524), Montezuma County, CO. It is likely that these individuals were removed during excavations funded by the Colorado State Legislature and led by Wilmarth, along with the Wetherill brothers and D.W. Ayers, to develop an exhibit for the Columbian Exposition at the Chicago World\\'s Fair in 1893, and the individuals were transferred to the Colorado Historical Society that same year (O.714.1, O.1732.1, O.1737.1 [1-2]).
