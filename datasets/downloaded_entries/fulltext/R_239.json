Prior to 1900, General William Jackson Palmer acquired what became known as the Lang-Bixby Collection, which he subsequently transferred to The Colorado College. Beginning in the late 1960s, the Lang-Bixby Collection was transferred, along with other collections from The Colorado College Museum, through long-term loans to the Fine Arts Center (formerly known as the Taylor Museum and the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center) and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (formerly known as the Denver Museum of Natural History).
