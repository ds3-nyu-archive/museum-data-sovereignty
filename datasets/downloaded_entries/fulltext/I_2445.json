In 1941, the resulting collection was donated to the Colorado \\nSprings Pioneers Museum by the El Paso County Pioneer Association. No \\nknown individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects can \\nbe identified.\\n    The Pesedeuinge site has been identified as an Anasazi occupation \\nsite during 1200-1475 AD and 1510-1680 AD based on ceramics, tool \\nmanufacture, and architecture. The oral history of San Juan Pueblo \\nindicates Pesedeuinge is an ancestral home and was also used as a place \\nof refuge. Consultation evidence also indicates affiliation with the \\nPueblo of Santa Clara, the Pueblo of Zuni, and the Hopi Tribe.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Colorado \\nSprings Pioneers Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof four individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the \\nColorado Springs Pioneers Museum have also determined that, pursuant to \\n25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity \\nwhich can be reasonably traced between these Native American human \\nremains and the Hopi Tribe, the Pueblo of San Juan, the Pueblo of Santa \\nClara, and the Pueblo of Zuni.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hopi Tribe, the \\nPueblo of San Juan, the Pueblo of Santa Clara, and the Pueblo of Zuni. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects should contact David Ryan, Museum Registrar, Colorado Springs \\nPioneers Museum, 215 S. Tejon, Colorado Springs, CO 80903-2283; \\ntelephone: (716) 578-6650, before August 23, 1996. Repatriation of the \\nhuman remains and associated funerary objects to the Hopi Tribe, the \\nPueblo of San Juan, the Pueblo of Santa Clara, and the Pueblo of Zuni \\nmay begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n\\n    Dated: July 11, 1996.\\nFrancis P.
