The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n\\n        In 1949, the University of New Mexico (UNM) conducted an archeological field school at site LA 46316 (Wahaniak Shukuk Shtuitauwa/Correo Snake Pit) in Valencia County, NM. UNM students collected cultural objects from the site, many made of perishable materials. Limited additional collecting at the site by UNM probably took place in the year or years immediately following the field school. The items removed from site LA 46316 include 90 sacred objects commonly called prayer sticks, materials for making prayer sticks, decomposed prayer sticks, and six lots of loose feathers, at least some of which were a part of prayer sticks.\\n        The collection was transferred to the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Due to poor documentation and analysis, the full extent and nature of the collection emerged only recently, as analysts began detailed studies of the cultural objects. To date, the UMN collection from site LA 46316 includes the sacred objects detailed above as well as other cultural items and two partial sets of human remains, which require additional consultation and analysis before determinations can be made.\\n        Based on radiocarbon dating, site LA 46316 was first used around B.C. 1400, and remained in use for centuries. The site is an ecumenical shrine, containing a travertine dome with dry deposits. The first documented excavation of the site occurred in 1917 by Elsie Clews Parsons, who reported even earlier activities on the site by \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreasure seekers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Parsons described the shrine as a Laguna shrine, but stated that the site was used by visitors from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcoma, Zuni, and other towns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At the time of the UNM field school in 1949, the site was on privately owned land, but more recently, the land area was purchased by the Pueblo of Laguna. Today, the Pueblo of Laguna continues to use the site and considers itself the custodian of the shrine. During a 2011 inspection of the sacred objects, delegates from the Pueblo of Laguna confirmed the presence of Laguna and Acoma sacred objects in the collection and indicated that other sacred objects may be related to the Zuni and Hopi tribes. The sacred objects in this notice are reasonably believed to be affiliated with the Pueblo of Laguna as well as other Pueblo Indians (including, but not limited to, the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico).\\n        In response to consultations with Indian tribes (including in a letter from the Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, representing the Pueblo in its role as land owner and custodian of the shrine), the staff of the Maxwell Museum will rebury the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprayer sticks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprayer stick materials,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and loose feathers from site LA 46316.
