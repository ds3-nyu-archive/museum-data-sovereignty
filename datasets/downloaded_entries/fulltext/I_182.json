The site was disturbed during installation of a sewage treatment system. The State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Water Quality contracted Ann Peak and Associates to perform a test excavation of the site. Human remains were identified and reinterred at the time of the excavation in cooperation with the Elem Indian Colony. In 1981-1982, the collection was transferred to the UC Davis Department of Anthropology Museum. In 2016, human remains were newly identified within faunal collections from the site. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains have been determined to be Native American based on the archeological context of the site. Cultural material from the site includes projectile points, bifaces, flakes, fauna, and groundstone. One radiocarbon date indicate occupation of the site approximately 3,500 to 2,100 years ago. Projectile points indicates a broad temporal range, from 10,000 years ago to the late prehistoric period. Geographic, anthropological, archeological, historical, linguistic, and traditional sources provide evidence of cultural affiliation between the human remains and contemporary Pomo people. Anthropological sources designate Clear Lake as the aboriginal territory of Pomo and Lake Miwok groups. The Southern Clear Lake/Lower Lake area is attributed to the Southeastern Pomo (Kroeber 1925, McCarthy 1985, McLendon and Lowy 1978, McLendon and Oswalt 1978; Swanton 1952; White et al. 2002). Linguistic evidence suggests that Clear Lake is the proto-Pomo homeland (Golla 2007, Oswalt 1964, Whistler1984). Information provided by the Koi Nation indicates that this area is the center of Koi ancestral lands and the tribe\\'s pre-contact political, cultural, and spiritual center.
