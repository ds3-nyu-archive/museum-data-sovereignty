This site is on Federal land, within the boundaries of the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest and Thunder Basin National Grassland. Oil company workers discovered some human remains under rocks near their worksite approximately 64 kilometers southwest of Upton, Wyoming. The burial had previously been disturbed and the rocks originally used to cover the individuals had been moved. The Weston and Converse County Sheriff\\'s departments were notified at the time of discovery and the human remains were sent to Dr. George Gill at the University of Wyoming for biological analysis. On October 12, 1982, Dr. Gill, George Darlington, David McKee, and David Darlington (USDA Forest Service) conducted follow-up excavations at the discovery site and collected additional human remains. The human remains were found in sand deposits on top of a butte overlooking the valley below. They appeared not to have been buried but simply covered with large flat stones.\\n        The human remains were analyzed for Native American heritage, age, and sex by the professional staff of the University of Wyoming. The remains consist of four American Indian individuals. They are fragmented, and many bone elements were not present. The most complete individual is an adult female who was 50-65 years of age. The second set of remains is an adult male represented by only a few bone fragments. A third set of remains is of a child 6-7 years of age. An infant child is represented by a fourth set of fragmentary remains. No known individuals were identified. The two associated funerary objects are two small and partial damaged tubular non-human (canid) bone beads\\n        Determinations Made by the USDA Forest Service Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests and Thunder Basin National Grassland\\n        Officials of the USDA Forest Service MBRTB have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on archaeological evidence.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the two objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Federal Claims, the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of the Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma (previously listed as the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma); Chippewa-Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana; Crow Tribe of Montana; and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects may be to the Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma (previously listed as the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma); Chippewa-Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana; Crow Tribe of Montana; and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Thomas Whitford, District Ranger, USDA Forest Service MBRTB, 2468 Jackson Street, Laramie, WY, telephone (307) 745-2443, by November 17, 2014.
