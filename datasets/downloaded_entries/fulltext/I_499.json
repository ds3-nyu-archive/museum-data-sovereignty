The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Lake County Discovery Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Michigan; Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Michigan; Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan; Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, Michigan (previously listed as the Huron Potawatomi, Inc.); Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; Sac & Fox Nation, Oklahoma; Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan; and the Sault Ste.

The museum has no record of when these human remains were added to the collection or how they came to the museum. There is no additional information available about the human remains. No known individuals were identified. The human remains have been stored in the museum based on the type of bone fragment (i.e. vertebrae are stored together). Accession records indicate that some of the bone fragments are related to other bone fragments in the collection. The two associated funerary objects are one lot of pottery sherds and one bird skull.\\n        Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.16, the Secretary of the Interior may make a recommendation for a transfer of control of culturally unidentifiable human remains and associated funerary objects. In June 2016, the Lake County Discovery Museum requested that the Secretary, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee, recommend the proposed transfer of control of the culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects in this notice to the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Michigan. The Review Committee, acting pursuant to its responsibility under 25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(5), considered the request at its July 2016 meeting and recommended to the Secretary that the proposed transfer of control proceed.
