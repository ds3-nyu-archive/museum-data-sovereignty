Mr. Holman then donated the objects to the Monterey Museum of Art on November 20, 1978. The 193 objects of cultural patrimony are 42 harpoon or projectile points, 38 pendants or beads, 3 fire-starters, 4 hand tools, 6 fishing weights, 37 carvings, 1 scraper, 3 dogsled runners, 1 club, 4 needles or awls, and 54 other objects made of ivory, bone, wood and stone.\\n        In the 1978 Deed of Gift to the Monterey Museum of Art, Mr. Holman notes that the objects were excavated from a site 125 miles east of Nome, AK, and were said to date to 6,000 years or more before present.
