The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n\\n        This notice corrects the culturally affiliated Native Hawaiian organizations identified during the claimant process and provides new museum contact information for a Notice of Intent to Repatriate Cultural Items published in the Federal Register of October 10, 2002 (FR Doc 02-25874, page 63152) for unassociated funerary objects removed from Lana`i, HI.\\n        The Federal Register notice of October 10, 2002 is corrected by substituting paragraph numbers 5 and 6 with the following paragraphs:\\n        Officials of the Bishop Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B), the 97 cultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native Hawaiian individual. Officials of the Bishop Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and Hui Kako`o.
