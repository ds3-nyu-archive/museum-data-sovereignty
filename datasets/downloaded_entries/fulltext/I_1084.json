Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains may contact the Bishop Museum. Repatriation of the human remains to the tribe stated below may occur if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n        \\n          DATES:\\n          Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains should contact the Bishop Museum at the address below by March 28, 2012. \\n        \\n        \\n          ADDRESSES:\\n          Betty Lou Kam, Vice President, Cultural Collections, Bishop Museum, 1525 Bernice St., Honolulu, HI 96817, telephone (808) 848-4144. \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\\n        Notice is here given in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 25 U.S.C. 3003, of the completion of an inventory of human remains in the possession of the Bishop Museum. The human remains were removed from western North America, most likely from north-central California. \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        Consultation \\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Bishop Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California (Tachi Yokut Tribe). Correspondence in support of the assessment also was provided by the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California. In addition, the Bishop Museum contacted the Table Mountain Rancheria of California. \\n        \\n        History and Description of the Remains \\n        In June of 1966, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were given to Dr. Alan Zeigler by Dr. Grover Krantz, while Dr. Zeigler was studying at the University of California, Berkeley. No information is provided as to the origins of the remains, other than a note in Zeigler\\'s 1966 catalog listing the location as western North America. However, at the time, all of Dr. Zeigler\\'s work focused around the Alameda County and Fresno areas in California. Presumably, these human remains were given to Zeigler to complement his research collection. Remains representing a minimum of two individuals were accompanied by a tag that reads, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSex? Imm. (2863 A.C. Zeigler) Coll? Rec\\'d from G.

In 1968, Dr. Zeigler published \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuasi-agriculture in North-central California and its effect on aboriginal social structure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers, No. 38, pp. 52-67.
