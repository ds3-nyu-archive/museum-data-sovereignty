The remains were in the possession of Anthony Zallio, a private collector, who posthumously donated his collection in 1951 to the Department of Anthropology at Sacramento State College, CA (now California State University, Sacramento).\\n\\n        Information regarding the site location for the human remains and funerary objects does not exist; however, research done by professional staff at California State University, Sacramento indicates the human remains were most likely removed from site locations in Sacramento or Yolo counties, CA. No known individuals were identified. The 11 associated funerary objects are two shell beads, one lot of slate drills, two projectile points, one shell, and five Haliotis shell ornaments.\\n        Anthony Zallio lived in Sacramento during the 1920s and 1930s.

Zallio also travelled internationally, and collected objects and human remains from around the world. Zallio demarcated these items from the rest of his collection by indicating the place of origin in his personal ledger or upon the object. It is believed that objects that have not been marked or otherwise noted in his personal ledger were considered less noteworthy, and were most likely removed from the lower Sacramento Valley region.\\n        Sometime during the 1920s and 1930s, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown location in Amador County, CA.
