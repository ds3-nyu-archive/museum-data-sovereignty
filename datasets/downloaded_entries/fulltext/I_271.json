Workers contacted the Michigan State Police after encountering human remains while digging a trench for a water main on private land. The human remains were taken to the State Crime Lab for analysis and subsequently transferred to the UMMAA. After analyzing the human remains, archaeologists from the UMMAA and Indiana State Museum returned to the burial site to excavate the remaining portion of the trench. The individual had been buried in a semi-prone position within a bell-shaped pit. Several Post-Contact Period objects were found in association with the burial but were transferred to the Arenac County Historical Society instead of the UMMAA. The human remains are of one adolescent, indeterminate sex, 17-18 years old. Copper staining is present on the right ulna and radius. Peri-mortem sharp force trauma, possibly from a knife or blade, on some of the human remains may be the cause of death as there is no evidence of healing from this trauma. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects under the control of UMMAA.\\n        The human remains have been determined to be Native American based on burial treatment and diagnostic artifacts. A relationship of shared group identity can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains from this site and the Chippewa based on multiple lines of evidence. The associated funerary objects noted from the site are typical of the types of goods traded in the region from approximately A.D. 1760 to 1820.
