The remains were disturbed by the excavation of a water line for the city of Wenatchee. The remains came from a single excavator bucket load of sediment. The remains were thought to have come from very near the ground surface and were thought to be less than 100 years old and possibly to represent a single mass interment. The 11 associated funerary objects include one hammerstone, two edge ground cobbles, one net sinker, one stone core, one wooden coffin fragment, one biface, three flakes, and one maul.\\n        The remains were identified by archaeologists from Washington State University who were monitoring the water line excavation work (Galm 1980). At some unknown time after 1980, the remains were transferred to the University of Idaho. In 2000, the remains were returned to the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University.\\n        The site is within the traditional territory of Wenatchee Band of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.
