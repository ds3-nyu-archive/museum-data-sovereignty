The human remains and associated funerary objects are in the physical custody of the Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA) in Flagstaff, AZ. No known individuals were identified. The 2,107 associated funerary objects are 13 pottery bowls, 1 mineral (galena), 6 pottery jars (some fragmentary), 2,057 shell beads, 1 stone pendant, 2 stone scrapers, 1 shell pendant, 25 basket fragments, and 1 blanket.\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from AZ Q:1:58 in Apache County, AZ during legally authorized excavations. No known individuals were identified.

No known individuals were identified. The 11 associated funerary objects are 2 pottery bowls, 3 pottery jars, and 6 shell beads.\\n        Archeological site context and types of funerary objects suggest that all three sites were occupied by ancestral Puebloan peoples.
