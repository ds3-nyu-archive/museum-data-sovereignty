The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        Unassociated Funerary Objects\\n        In the late 19th century, six cultural items were collected in southwestern Alaska. Three of the cultural items were collected circa 1896-1899, placed on deposit at the Peabody Museum of Natural History in 1928, and formally donated to the Peabody Museum of Natural History in 1992. The remaining three cultural items were collected prior to 1880 when they were donated to the Peabody Museum of Natural History. The six cultural items are: One headdress, two bone necklaces, one ivory amulet, one bone drinking tube, and one oyster catcher rattle.\\n        In June 2015, representatives from the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska identified the six cultural items as part of a shaman\\'s outfit/paraphernalia (collectively the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSix Shaman\\'s Objects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and historic and contemporary scholars support this identification. Historic and contemporary scholars also state that Tlingit shamans were traditionally placed in above-ground grave houses along with their outfit/paraphernalia.\\n        Sacred Objects and Objects of Cultural Patrimony\\n\\n        In the late 19th century, one Chilkat robe and one Chilkat Woodworm pipe were collected from southwestern Alaska and in 1902 they were donated to the Peabody Museum of Natural History. In 1928 or 1929 one Raven rattle was collected from southwestern Alaska and was subsequently donated to the Peabody Museum of Natural History in 1966. In 1931, one Chilkat robe, was purchased in Juneau, Alaska and donated to the Peabody Museum of Natural History. During consultation, representatives from the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska identified the first Chilkat robe as depicting the Sea Monster crest, which belongs to the Wooshkeetaan Clan; the Chilkat Woodworm pipe as depicting the Woodworm crest, which belongs to the Ghaanaxhteid\\xc3\\xad Clan; the Raven rattle as being made by Jack Gamble (Dl\\'eet\\') of the Wooshkeetaan Clan; and the second Chilkat robe as depicting the Killerwhale crest which belongs to the Dakhl\\'aweidi Clan (collectively the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour Clan Objects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n        The representatives stated that, according to tribal custom, no individual could have legally alienated the Four Clan Objects from their respective clans. In addition, the representatives stated that members of the Wooshkeetaan, the Ghaanaxhteid\\xc3\\xad and the Dakhl\\'aweidi Clans need the Four Clan Objects to practice traditional ceremonies today. Evidence presented by the Central Council and independent scholars confirm the attribution of the crests to the specific clans, support the representative\\'s description of the legal significance of the crests as recording the clans\\' collective title to the Four Clan Objects, and corroborate that the Four Clan Objects are especially revered and feature prominently in traditional and present day ceremonial contexts.\\n        Determinations Made by the Peabody Museum of Natural History\\n        Officials of the Peabody Museum of Natural History have determined:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Unassociated Funerary Objects. Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the Six Shaman Objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Sacred Objects.
