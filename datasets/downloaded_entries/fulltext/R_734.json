In 1947, these \\ncultural items were acquired by the University Museum as part of the \\npurchase of the artifact collection of Fain White King.\\n    Based on the temper and character of the pottery, these cultural \\nitems have been determined to relate to the Middle Mississippian \\nCulture of the Mississippi Period (800-1600 A.D.). Based on \\ngeographical continuity, the University Museum has identified the \\nPeoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma as the likely descendant of the \\nMississippian culture in that part of Illinois.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nUniversity Museum, University of Arkansas have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these four cultural items are \\nreasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human \\nremains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or \\nceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have \\nbeen removed from a specific burial site of an Native American \\nindividual. Officials of the University Museum, University of Arkansas \\nhave also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these items and the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Peoria Tribe of \\nIndians of Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these objects should \\ncontact Michael P. Hoffman, Curator of Anthropology, University Museum, \\nUniversity of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72702; telephone: (501) 575-\\n3855 before August 23, 1999. Repatriation of these objects to the \\nPeoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: July 13, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
