The human remains were removed from Jemez Indian Reservation, Sandoval County, NM.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Prior to 2000, a detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Kingman Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs does not exert control over the human remains in this notice.\\n        On September 17, 2002, Calhoun County Probate Court transferred the public trust for Kingman Memorial Museum of Natural History from Battle Creek Public Schools to Kingman Museum, Incorporated, a private, nonprofit 501(c)(3) charitable organization. In April of 2006, collection ownership was transferred from the Battle Creek Public Schools to Kingman Museum, Incorporated.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the Jemez Indian Reservation, NM.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Papers located with the human remains indicate they belong to the Pueblo of Jemez. The original box in which the human remains were stored is lost.
