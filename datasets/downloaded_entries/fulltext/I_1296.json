The human remains were removed from Howkan, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Field Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Hydaburg Cooperative Association.\\n        In 1902, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from a grave south of Howkan, AK, by Charles F. Newcombe for the Field Museum of Natural History (Field Museum of Natural History accession number 850, catalog number 40935). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains have been identified as Native American, based on the specific cultural and geographic attribution in Field Museum of Natural History records. The records identify the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKaigani Haida\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom Shaman\\'s grave south of Howkan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Scholarly publications and consultation information provided by the Hydaburg Cooperative Association indicate that Howkan is considered to be within the traditional territory of the Kaigani Haida.

Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605, telephone (312) 665-7317, before February 4, 2010.
