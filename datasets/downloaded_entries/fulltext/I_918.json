The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects was made by the Logan Museum of Anthropology, Beloit College, professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1931, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a mound near Benton, AR, by Paul H. Nesbitt, curator of anthropology at the Logan Museum of Anthropology, Beloit College, and Frank Ellis, owner of the Ellis Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Maquoketa, IA. The mound was situated near the Saline River, but the precise site location is unknown. Museum records state that Nesbitt and Ellis were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstudying the mound groups\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Benton vicinity, and the two men excavated one burial, made surface collections at several locations, and obtained material from another collector. According to museum records, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[m]ost of the material was found on Mr. Ellis\\'s land along the Saline River\\xe2\\x80\\x9d near Benton, AR. After removal, the human remains and associated funerary objects were accessioned into the Logan Museum\\'s collection. The human remains are those of an adult male. No known individuals were identified. The 83 associated funerary objects are 1 ceramic bowl, 1 ceramic tripod bottle, 1 broken ceramic jar, 2 chipped-stone picks or chisels, 1 ground and scored rectangular stone object, 2 ground stone knives, 33 bivalve shells, 30 ceramic sherds, 10 mammal elements, 1 turtle shell fragment, and fragments of charcoal.\\n        The human remains are Native American based on the method of interment, associated funerary objects, and physical characteristics. The ceramic bowl is a shell-tempered, carinated vessel that is a two-panel example of Friendship Engraved var. Freeman. Its form, more common in the Ouachita River drainage than along the Saline River, is diagnostic of the Mid-Ouachita phase, dating to A.D. 1400-1500. Because the bowl is shell-tempered, it was probably made late in that period. The tripod bottle has a composite design, and Arkansas Archeological Survey archaeologist Mary Beth Trubitt observed that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ovals and crosshatched design on the body are typically found on Friendship Engraved carinated bowls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe horizontal line with pendant crosshatched triangles around the bottle neck is often seen around rims of bowls (Hempstead Engraved bowls that are usually grog-tempered, or Hardman Engraved bowls that are usually shell-tempered).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This evidence points to an estimated date for the bottle in the late 1400s.\\n        The bowl and the tripod bottle, both of which feature nearly identical designs, exhibit well-documented Late Caddo styles. The Benton, AR, area is in the northeastern portion of the traditional homeland of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. Significant Caddo archaeological sites such as Hughes Mound are located near Benton, AR. Archaeological and ethno-historical evidence indicates a relationship of shared group identity between the present-day Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and late prehistoric Caddo groups.\\n        Determinations Made by the Logan Museum of Anthropology, Beloit College\\n        Officials of the Logan Museum of Anthropology, Beloit College have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 83 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to William Green, Director, Logan Museum of Anthropology, Beloit College, Beloit, WI 53511, telephone (608) 363-2119, email greenb@beloit.edu, by October 15, 2013.
