The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In 1968, the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology acquired the collection of Mr. Fallis F. Rees, an amateur archeologist, who researched ancient civilizations. He housed his artifact collection in his Ko-Kas-Ki Museum in Pinedale, CO, before transferring it to the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology. The following cultural items came to the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology as part of the Rees Collection.\\n        At an unknown date, two stone figurine fragments (DU 3915 A-B) were removed from unknown sites near Gila Crossing Ruin in Maricopa or Pinal County, AZ, by an unknown individual. At an unknown date, one stone figurine fragment (DU 3915 C), depicting a female head and partial torso, was removed from an unknown site in the Gila River area, AZ, by an unknown individual. Fallis Rees obtained this object from Frank Midvale, a southwestern archeologist who lived and worked in southern and central Arizona. All three figurines (DU 3915 A-C) resemble Santa Cruz Phase figurines from the Snaketown site and are made from vesicular basalt. The archeological evidence places the Snaketown site within the archeologically-defined Hohokam tradition. Museum records indicate the figurine fragments were removed from cremation burials.\\n        At an unknown date, one stone cylinder with flat base (DU 3973) was removed from an unknown site near Phoenix Ruins in Maricopa County, AZ, by an unknown individual. The cylinder features a shallow depression on one end with two rattlesnakes carved head to tail on the rim. Fallis Rees obtained this object from Frank Midvale, a southwestern archeologist who lived and worked in southern and central Arizona. DU 3973 is identified as belonging to the Santa Cruz or Sacaton Phase of the Hohokam archeological tradition. Museum records indicate the cylinder was removed from a cremation burial.\\n        At an unknown date, two stone palettes (DU 3984 and 3987) were removed from unknown sites in Arizona by an unknown individual. DU 3984 features irregular incised triangles on the rim. DU 3987 is greenish-grey in color and features an incised groove border, beveled edges and a smoothed back. At an unknown date, one stone palette (DU 3986) was removed from an unknown site near Phoenix in Maricopa County, AZ, in the Salt River Valley, by an unknown individual. DU 3986 is made from soapstone and features a shallow incised border on a smoothed surface. At an unknown date, one stone palette (DU3989) was removed from an unknown site in New River, Maricopa County, AZ, by an unknown individual. DU 3989 features a water bird design with double incised lines inside the border and notched edges. Areas of loss have been reconstructed at some point prior to 1968. Fallis Rees obtained this object from Frank Midvale, a southwestern archeologist who lived and worked in southern and central Arizona. DU 3984 is identified as belonging to the Sacaton Phase of the Hohokam Archeological tradition. Museum records identify DU 3986, 3987, and 3989 as part of the Hohokam Archeological tradition.

The fragment features painted designs in black and white, partial double perforations, and beveled edges. At an unknown date, one stone fragment (DU 3992) was removed from an unknown site near Cashion in Maricopa County, AZ, by an unknown individual. The fragment features one edge with a continuous curved arc and the other edge with uneven curves including one partial perforation near one end. Both stone fragments (DU 3991 and 3992) show evidence of being burned and are believed to have been removed from cremation burials.
