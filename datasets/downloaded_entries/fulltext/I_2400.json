No known individuals were identified. \\nThe 99 associated funerary objects include projectile points, a stone \\nknife, shell beads, a bone awl fragment, a bird bone whistle fragment, \\nshell pendants, pottery sherds, burnt faunal material, and burnt \\ncordage.\\n    In 1931, human remains representing five individuals were recovered \\nfrom site M-4 along the shoreline of Cronise Basin, San Bernardino \\nCounty, CA during legally authorized excavations by Malcolm Rogers, San \\nDiego Museum of Man. No known individuals were identified. The 145 \\nassociated funerary objects include flaked stone knives, projectile \\npoints, vesicular basalt abrader and smoothers, bone awls, bone \\npressure flaker, ceramic vessels and sherds, shell beads, shell \\nornaments, burnt faunal remains, cordage and net,\\n\\n[[Page 45874]]\\n\\nstone arrow shaft straightener, obsidian nodules, quartz nodule, and \\nochre.\\n    In 1932, human remains representing two individuals were recovered \\nfrom site M-5 along the shoreline of Cronise Basin, San Bernardino \\nCounty, CA during legally authorized excavations by Malcolm Rogers, San \\nDiego Museum of Man. No known individuals were identified. The six \\nassociated funerary objects include shell beads, a clam shell fragment, \\nand burnt faunal material.\\n    In 1932, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom site M-10 along the shoreline of Cronise Basin, San Bernardino \\nCounty, CA during legally authorized excavations by Malcolm Rogers, San \\nDiego Museum of Man. No known individuals were identified. The five \\nassociated funerary objects include shell beads, a biconically drilled \\nstone tube, ochre, and a projectile point.\\n    The eighteen cultural items include ceramic vessels, sherds, a bone \\ntube, shell beads, projectile points, an olivella bead, limpet shell \\nbead, and a chipped stone knife. Between 1928 and 1932, these cultural \\nitems were recovered from disturbed cremations at Cronise Basin sites \\nM-1, M-10, M-13, and M-14 during legally authorized excavations by \\nMalcomb Rogers of the San Diego Museum of Man. The human remains with \\nthese items were not collected.\\n    Based on the common occurrence of brown and buff ware ceramics, \\ntype of projectile points, and presence of shell beads from the \\nsouthern coastal California area, these human remains may be dated to \\nthe Shoshonean Period of this area, c. 1550-1650 A.D. Archeological \\nevidence indicates a clear continuity between the cultures present in \\nthis area during this period and the Serrano and Vanyume peoples \\npresent in the area at the time of European contact as noted in Spanish \\nexploration documents. Oral tradition evidence presented by \\nrepresentatives of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians indicates \\nthis area is recognized as the ancestral homeland.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Bureau \\nof Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof twelve individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the \\nBureau of Land Management have also determined that, pursuant to 25 \\nU.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the 255 objects listed above are reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \\nOfficials of the Bureau of Land Management have determined that, \\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B), these eighteen cultural items are \\nreasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human \\nremains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or \\nceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have \\nbeen removed from a specific burial site of an Native American \\nindividual. Lastly, officials of the Bureau of Land Management have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains, associated funerary \\nobjects, and unassociated funerary objects and the San Manuel Band of \\nMission Indians.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the San Manuel Band of \\nMission Indians. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains, \\nassociated funerary objects, and unassociated funerary objects should \\ncontact Russell Kaldenberg, Cultural Program Lead, Division of \\nEcosystems Sciences and Lands, California State Office, Bureau of Land \\nManagement, 2135 Butano Drive, Sacramento, CA 95825; telephone: (916) \\n979-2840, before September 29, 1997. Repatriation of the human remains, \\nassociated funerary objects, and unassociated funerary objects to the \\nSan Manuel Band of Mission Indians may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: August 25, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
