The human remains are part of a large collection of archeological material donated by Alfred Ticacek to the Butler County Museum in 1973. In October of 2015, these human remains were discovered in storage at the Butler County Museum, and were given to the NSHS on October 21, 2015. The human remains were examined by a physical anthropologist, who indicated that the human remains are co-mingled, and they lack site feature-specific information. Based on crania and select post-cranial elements, the human remains represent, at minimum, three adults (one male, one female, and one indeterminate with regard to sex) and three children (one infant, one individual about 2 years in age, and one individual between 8 and 10 years in age). No known individuals were identified.

It is associated principally with the Grand and Republican bands of the Pawnee Confederacy. The affiliation is clearly documented through archeological materials (particularly architecture style, ceramic decoration and Euroamerican trade goods), as well as archival and historic cartographic sources.
