Based on linguistic evidence, the peoples in this area were known as the Hokan, and are referred to in archeological literature as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYuman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A clear continuum of language and material culture exists in this area from the late precontact period into the contact era, supported by the presence of European items among the associated funerary objects. Though the Diegueno and Kumeyaay native communities of Imperial and San Diego counties were badly fragmented, they are credited with holding the lands where the above-listed sites are located and recognize this area as an ancestral homeland. Historic records of Spanish and early American explorations and studies further support these affiliations. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Bureau of Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 62 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Bureau of Land Management also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the 1,982 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Bureau of Land Management have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Reservation, the Capitan Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California, the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, the Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, the Cuyapaipe Community of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, the Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, the La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Reservation, the Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, the Jamul Indian Village, the Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, the San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California, the Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, and the Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California.
