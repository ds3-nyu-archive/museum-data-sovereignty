The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        In the early 1900s, cultural items were collected by the Fred Harvey Company and donated to the Heard Museum by the Fred Harvey Corporation in 1978. The five cultural items are one lot of three ceramic jars with mesh sleeves and two canvas pouches which are part of an altar setting (635P); one lot of a white stone mountain lion fetish and hide medicine pouch (1458CI); one lot of three stone fetishes and a hide pouch (1692CI); one stone fetish used by Zuni medicine societies, circa 1934 (1704CI); and one lot that consists of a Pueblo II period ceramic paint jar, hide pouch, ceramic bowl, and 16 peyote fetishes, circa 1900 (1746CI).\\n        In 1975, two cultural items were donated to the Heard Museum by Mr. C.G. Wallace. The two cultural items consist of a stone fetish (NA-SW-ZU-F-92) and a carved horn fetish or container (NA-SW-ZU-F-93).\\n        In 1974, two cultural items were donated to the Heard Museum by Woodar\\'s Indian Arts. The two cultural items are a pair of wrapped feathers (NA-SW-ZU-I-3a,b) and a feather fetish (NA-SW-ZU-I-4). The cultural items are associated with the Zuni medicine society.\\n\\n        On March 15, 1996, and October 17, 2008, representatives of the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico consulted with museum staff, examined the collections and determined that the above-described objects were sacred objects needed by Zuni religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religion, and eligible for repatriation under NAGPRA.\\n        \\n        Officials of the Heard Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C), the nine cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. Officials of the Heard Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the sacred objects should contact Frank Goodyear, Jr., Director, Heard Museum, 2301 N. Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85004, telephone (602) 252-8840, before March 4, 2009.
