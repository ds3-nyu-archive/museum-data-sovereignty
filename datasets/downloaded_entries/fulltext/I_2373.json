No known \\nindividuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects \\ninclude a string of beads, wampum, and a wampum shell bracelet.\\n    Based on funerary objects, this railhead site has been determined \\nto be a Narragansett burial site during the historic period \\n(approximately 16th century until the late 1600s). Historical documents \\nand archeological evidence indicates this area was occupied by the \\nNarragansett Indian Tribe during this period.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Rhode \\nIsland Historical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Rhode \\nIsland Historical Society have also determined that, pursuant to 25 \\nU.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the three objects listed above are reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \\nLastly, officials of the Rhode Island Historical Society have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects and the Narragansett Indian Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Narragansett Indian \\nTribe. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects should contact Linda Eppich, Curator, or Albert T. \\nKlyberg, Director, Rhode Island Historical Society, 110 Benevolent St., \\nProvidence, RI 02906, telephone (401) 331-8575, before April 8, 1998. \\nRepatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to \\nthe Narragansett Indian Tribe may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\n    The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations \\nwithin this notice.\\nDated: March 3, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
