The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Franklin County, WA, and an unknown location along the Lower Snake River.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains and funerary objects was made by the WSU professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Nez Perce Tribe, Idaho; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); and the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Indian Group\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        At some date between 1950 and 1970, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from an unknown site in Franklin or Benton County, WA. The human remains were found among other archeological materials from sites excavated during this time period along the Lower Snake River. The remains, however, do not match any of the descriptions of excavated remains from any of the known sites. It is believed that these remains were excavated from one of several known burial sites along the Lower Snake River as archeologists at WSU were working at such sites between 1950 and 1970. The labels associated with the remains include burial numbers but not site numbers. No known individuals were identified. The 18 associated funerary objects are 1 projectile point, 3 lots of bag residue, 2 lots of plant remains, 3 lots of wood fragments, 1 lot of metal fragments, 1 lot of leather fragments, 1 lot of glass fragments, 2 lots of flakes, 1 lot of ceramic fragments, 2 lots of fabric fragments, and 1 lot of paper bags.\\n\\n        In 1958, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from Site 45FR1 (also known as 45FR42 or Fishhook Island) in Franklin County, WA by members of the Columbia Archaeological Society (CAS). Notes made by the CAS describe the burials as being of a late pre-contact age because of the lack of items of Euro-American manufacture among the associated funerary items. Correspondence between the CAS and Richard Daugherty, who was a member of the Anthropology faculty at WSU in 1958, discuss the possible deposition of the human remains and artifacts from these excavations at WSU but there is no record of such a deposit. The remains were found among a large set of remains known as the former \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWSU Teaching Collection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was used between 1968 and 1995. No known individuals were identified.
