The mound, identified as comprising three distinct layers, included, at minimum, 33 distinct burials, midden by-products (lithic, pottery, and faunal materials), and approximately three hearth features. All the human remains and artifacts have remained in the possession of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History Anthropology Collection since their removal from the mound. No known individuals were identified. The sex and age of all the individuals has not been definitively determined (male and female human remains are present). At least one infant is among the human remains. Incomplete skeletal remains including burnt and unburnt bones, and cremated remains. The 914 associated funerary objects are 191 pottery sherds, 205 lithic artifacts, 39 animal bones and animal bone tools, 412 beads, 55 unworked shells, one copper bear claw, and 11 charred plant remains.\\n        The mound is estimated to have been occupied by four distinct groups, first in the Early Woodland period, and again in the Middle and Late Woodlands. Some evidence of occupation by a panhandle archaic group prior to the mound\\'s construction exists. The mound\\'s initial construction was most likely carried out by a Late Adena group.
