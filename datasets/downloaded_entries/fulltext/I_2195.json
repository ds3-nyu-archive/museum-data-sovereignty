The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; the Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; the Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco, and Tawakonie), Oklahoma; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. \\n        In 1941, human remains representing 14 individuals were recovered from site LA 83 (Pueblo Pardo Ruin or Grey Town), Socorro County, NM during legally authorized excavations conducted as part of a field school program through Washington and Jefferson College. No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is one lot of corn kernels and faunal remains. \\n        Based on burial location and associated funerary objects, these individuals have been identified as Native American. Based on material cultural and architectural features, site LA 83 has been dated to the Pueblo III to Pueblo IV period (A.D. 1300-1630). \\n        During 1935-6, 1939-40, and in 1980, human remains representing a minimum of eight individuals were recovered from site LA 95 (Quarai site), Torrance County, NM during legally authorized excavations conducted as part of stabilization efforts sponsored variously by the Museum of New Mexico, the School of American Research, the University of New Mexico, and the Works Progress Administration. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Based on archeological context, these individuals have been identified as Native American. Based on material culture, architectural features, and documentary evidence, site LA 95 has been dated to the Pueblo III through the early historic period (A.D. 1100-1680). \\n        During 1944-1945, human remains representing a minimum of seven individuals were recovered from site LA 97 (Abo site), Torrance County, NM during legally authorized excavations conducted by the Museum of New Mexico. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n\\n        Based on archeological context, these individuals have been identified as Native American. Based on material culture and architectural features, site LA 97 has been dated to the Pueblo IV through the early historic period (A.D. 1300-1680). \\n        Based on archeological context and regional cultural chronology, these sites have been identified as Ancestral Puebloan. Historical evidence also records these sites as trade centers that enjoyed frequent contact with non-Puebloan tribes. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 29 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the one object listed above is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; the Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; the Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico; and a non-Federally recognized Indian group, the Piro-Manso-Tiwa Tribe.
