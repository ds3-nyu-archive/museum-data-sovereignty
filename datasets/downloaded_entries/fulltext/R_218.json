In 1983, over 300 items from the Case collection were donated to the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History. After extensive consultation, official representatives of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota submitted a repatriation claim for five items. The five sacred objects are pipes. The pipe represented by catalog number 33032 is comprised of a red pipestone bowl with a lead inlay and wood stem, which is decorated with black banding. The pipe represented by catalog number 33035 is comprised of a red pipestone bowl and stem, which are joined by a wooden connector. The pipe represented by catalog number 33043 is comprised of a red pipestone bowl and wood stem. The pipe represented by catalog number 33047 is comprised of a black pipestone bowl and wood stem, which is decorated with red, white and blue quillwork, as well as red and yellow ribbons. The pipe represented by catalog number 33049 is comprised of a black pipestone bowl and wood stem, which is decorated with knobby protrusions and a black amorphous pattern.\\n        The provenance of the pipes supports cultural affiliation to the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota, which is comprised of Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara peoples.
