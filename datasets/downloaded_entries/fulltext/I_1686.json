The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Pacific Lutheran University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation and Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.\\n        In 1932, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from a site near the mouth of Swan Creek, north of the town of LeBeau, Walworth County, SD, by Dr. W.H.
