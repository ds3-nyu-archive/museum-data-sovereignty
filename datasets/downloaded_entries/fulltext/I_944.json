The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the USDA Forest Service and the National Park Service professional staff, along with a team of research consultants, in consultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo); Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of San Juan); Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; Ysleta del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        History and description of the remains\\n        Prior to 1962, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from an unknown site or sites in the Falls Creek cave area, north of Durango, in LaPlata County, CO. The human remains were included with collection materials from the Falls Creek Rock Shelters (site 5LP1434) and in the custody of the Mesa Verde National Park. In 2009, Mesa Verde National Park transferred these remains to the San Juan National Forest. Detailed assessment of the accompanying documentation and analysis of the human remains determined that these remains are not part of the collections from the Falls Creek Rock Shelters and that they were donated to Mesa Verde National Park in 1962 from the Durango Public Library in Durango, CO. Provenience information is designated as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFalls Creek Cave Area.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The remains include a complete skull of a young adult male, 20-34 years of age; a skull of an adult male, 35-49 years of age; and a skull of an adult male, 35-49 years of age. All three of the skulls exhibit some reconstruction and remnants of modifications made for purposes of display. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Analysis of the human remains by Mesa Verde National Park staff concluded that they were Ancestral Puebloan dating to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBasketmaker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d period.
