Between the initial 1932 discovery and 1960, human remains representing, at minimum, 76 individuals were excavated from the Juntunen Site. In 1959, Mr. Charles Juntunen, the landowner of the site, found the human remains while preparing a road using a bulldozer. Mr. Juntunen contacted the University of Michigan to salvage the remains, and Alan McPherron and James Griffin conducted multiple excavations. The Juntunen Site contains five ossuaries (one large and four small, both defined by secondary-burials), one infant burial, and additional human remains collected from the surface of a mound. The largest ossuary discovered at the site consisted of a lower burial pit (Feature 10) separated by a sterile layer of soil from an upper burial pit (Feature 11), both of which were lined with birch bark. At minimum, 33 individuals were found in this ossuary buried in bundles, with a high number of individuals exhibiting pathological expressions of tuberculosis in conjunction with chronic vitamin deficiencies. The four smaller ossuaries contained, at minimum, 32 individuals. Additionally, an infant burial was discovered in a pit that was covered by a collapsed log roof. Human remains were also recovered from the surface of the site representing, at minimum, 10 individuals. No known individuals were identified. There are 71 associated funerary objects including: 1 medicine bundle containing 2 stone points; 1 red ground stone or palette; 2 ground stones; 3 flint cores; 13 stone flakes; 3 bone chisels; 3 harpoon heads; 2 small bone awls; 2 large bone awls; 1 otter skull with soil; 1 lot consisting of a strike-a-light kit\\xe2\\x80\\x94iron pyrite, flint, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cskitaagin;\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1 copper awl; 1 bone punch or splinter with polished tips; 1 lot of twined textile fragments from the medicine bag; 2 miniature ceramic vessels; 29 shell and fish beads; 1 lot of approximately 700 Marginella shells that formed a shell beaded band or belt; and 3 lots of soil from the largest ossuary.\\n        McPherron and Griffin noted a long history of occupation at the site. Archeological analysis suggests that the location was used as a large, seasonal fishing camp during the Late Woodland period. The burials were found to date between 1200-1400 A.D. based on ceramic typology and Carbon 14 analysis. The burial treatments found at the site and in the ossuaries are consistent with the time period.\\n        In 1963, human remains representing, at minimum, seven individuals (1 elderly male, 3 adult females, 2 adult males, and 1 infant/neonate) were excavated from Arrowhead Drive Site by Charles Eyman of the University of Michigan. No known individuals were identified. The 20 associated funerary objects include: 1 medicine bundle containing 7 chert fragments; 1 animal bone lot with beaver incisors, black bear maxilla, bird and mammal bones; 8 stone fragments including specular hematite; 1 lot of the remains of a skin bag; 1 lot of shell and soil; 1 antler tool with a beaver incisor found near Burial 7; and 1 lot of ceramic sherds from two partial vessels.\\n        This site is adjacent to the Juntunen Site; however, the mortuary treatment of the human remains buried at Arrowhead Drive show primary interment in the mound, whereas burials at the Juntunen site were interred in secondary bundles. Individuals at this site also show more cavities and tooth wear than those from the adjacent excavation. The burial feature at this site was found to date between 70 B.C.-170 A.D. based on Carbon 14 dating and diagnostic artifacts, falling within the Middle Woodland period and pre-dating the Juntunen Site by more than 1,000 years.\\n        Sometime prior to 1924, human remains representing, at minimum one individual were removed from an unknown site in Saint Ignace, MI. The University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology purchased the human remains from Reverend L. P. Rowland in November of 1924 as part of a larger collection known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRowland Collection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which spans approximately 1,000 archeological and ethnographic objects from various locations in North America. No information on provenience is present except a reference to Saint Ignace, MI on the catalog card. Individual number 1276 was determined to be a middle aged adult 30-50 years of age, possibly female with cranial modifications from cradle boarding. No known individuals were identified. No funerary objects are present.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Michigan\\n        Officials of the University of Michigan have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Based on cranial morphology, dental traits, as well as the pottery and artifacts associated with the burials that all pre-date the contact period the human remains are determined to be Native American.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission, the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects, were removed is the aboriginal land of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians of the Bad River Reservation, Wisconsin; Bay Mills Indian Community, Michigan; Bois Forte Band (Nett Lake) of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Chippewa-Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy\\'s Reservation, Montana; Fond du Lac Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Grand Portage Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Michigan; Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Michigan; Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin; Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation of Wisconsin; Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Michigan; Leech Lake Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Michigan; Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan; Mille Lacs Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota; Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma; Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin; Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, Minnesota; Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan; Sault Ste.

Between the initial 1932 discovery and 1960, human remains representing, at minimum, 76 individuals were excavated from the Juntunen Site. In 1959, Mr. Charles Juntunen, the landowner of the site, found the human remains while preparing a road using a bulldozer. Mr. Juntunen contacted the University of Michigan to salvage the remains, and Alan McPherron and James Griffin conducted multiple excavations. The Juntunen Site contains five ossuaries (one large and four small, both defined by secondary-burials), one infant burial, and additional human remains collected from the surface of a mound. The largest ossuary discovered at the site consisted of a lower burial pit (Feature 10) separated by a sterile layer of soil from an upper burial pit (Feature 11), both of which were lined with birch bark. At minimum, 33 individuals were found in this ossuary buried in bundles, with a high number of individuals exhibiting pathological expressions of tuberculosis in conjunction with chronic vitamin deficiencies. The four smaller ossuaries contained, at minimum, 32 individuals. Additionally, an infant burial was discovered in a pit that was covered by a collapsed log roof. Human remains were also recovered from the surface of the site representing, at minimum, 10 individuals. No known individuals were identified. There are 71 associated funerary objects including: 1 medicine bundle containing 2 stone points; 1 red ground stone or palette; 2 ground stones; 3 flint cores; 13 stone flakes; 3 bone chisels; 3 harpoon heads; 2 small bone awls; 2 large bone awls; 1 otter skull with soil; 1 lot consisting of a strike-a-light kit\\xe2\\x80\\x94iron pyrite, flint, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cskitaagin;\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1 copper awl; 1 bone punch or splinter with polished tips; 1 lot of twined textile fragments from the medicine bag; 2 miniature ceramic vessels; 29 shell and fish beads; 1 lot of approximately 700 Marginella shells that formed a shell beaded band or belt; and 3 lots of soil from the largest ossuary. \n McPherron and Griffin noted a long history of occupation at the site. Archeological analysis suggests that the location was used as a large, seasonal fishing camp during the Late Woodland period. The burials were found to date between 1200-1400 A.D. based on ceramic typology and Carbon 14 analysis. The burial treatments found at the site and in the ossuaries are consistent with the time period. \n In 1963, human remains representing, at minimum, seven individuals (1 elderly male, 3 adult females, 2 adult males, and 1 infant/neonate) were excavated from Arrowhead Drive Site by Charles Eyman of the University of Michigan. No known individuals were identified. The 20 associated funerary objects include: 1 medicine bundle containing 7 chert fragments; 1 animal bone lot with beaver incisors, black bear maxilla, bird and mammal bones; 8 stone fragments including specular hematite; 1 lot of the remains of a skin bag; 1 lot of shell and soil; 1 antler tool with a beaver incisor found near Burial 7; and 1 lot of ceramic sherds from two partial vessels. \n This site is adjacent to the Juntunen Site; however, the mortuary treatment of the human remains buried at Arrowhead Drive show primary interment in the mound, whereas burials at the Juntunen site were interred in secondary bundles. Individuals at this site also show more cavities and tooth wear than those from the adjacent excavation. The burial feature at this site was found to date between 70 B.C.-170 A.D. based on Carbon 14 dating and diagnostic artifacts, falling within the Middle Woodland period and pre-dating the Juntunen Site by more than 1,000 years. \n Sometime prior to 1924, human remains representing, at minimum one individual were removed from an unknown site in Saint Ignace, MI. The University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology purchased the human remains from Reverend L. P. Rowland in November of 1924 as part of a larger collection known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRowland Collection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which spans approximately 1,000 archeological and ethnographic objects from various locations in North America. No information on provenience is present except a reference to Saint Ignace, MI on the catalog card. Individual number 1276 was determined to be a middle aged adult 30-50 years of age, possibly female with cranial modifications from cradle boarding. No known individuals were identified.
