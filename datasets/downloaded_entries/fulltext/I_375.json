The human remains were removed from Alamosa County, CO.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Luther Bean Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma (previously listed as the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma); Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo); Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of San Juan); Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe of Arizona; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Ute Tribe (previously listed as the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        In 1962, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from a site in Alamosa County, CO. The human remains were uncovered in the 1960s when an artificial lake and bathhouse were being developed. The human remains were then excavated by two Adams State University students and brought to the Luther Bean Museum where they have been housed ever since. In 2005, the Museum brought in a graduate student from the University of Montana with training in Native American osteology to the museum to examine the remains. The remains were determined to be a Native American woman in her early twenties. The human remains were probably not more than a few hundred years old. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At the time of the excavation and removal of these human remains, the land from which the human remains were removed was not the tribal land of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. In 2017, the Luther Bean Museum consulted with all Indian tribes who are recognized as aboriginal to the area from which these Native American human remains were removed.

None of these Indian tribes agreed to accept control of the human remains. In 2017, the Luther Bean Museum agreed to transfer control of the human remains to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado.\\n        Determinations Made by the Luther Bean Museum\\n        Officials of the Luther Bean Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on an examination by an osteologist.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(2)(i), the disposition of the human remains may be to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Danielle Persinger, Luther Bean Museum, 208 Edgemont Boulevard, Alamosa, CO 81101, telephone (719) 587-7151, email lutherbean@adams.edu, by October 23, 2017.
