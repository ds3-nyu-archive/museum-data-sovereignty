Objects include abraders, animal \\nbones, arrow points (metal and stone), beads (glass and shell), bells, \\nbracelets, bridle bits, buttons (glass, metal, and shell), cradle board \\nfragments, coins (American and Spanish), cups, ear bobs, fabric, felt, \\nfiles, fire steels, flints, glass, gun parts, hide, hoes, knives, \\nleather, matting, medals, metal, a mirror frame, paint, pebbles, \\npigment, pipes, pottery sherds, projectile points, rings, scrapers, \\nseeds, shells, spoons, spurs, stones, thimbles, vegetal material, \\nwhetstones, and wood. All of the objects are believed to have been \\nintentionally placed with or near individual Native American human \\nremains as part of a death rite or ceremony. The individual human \\nremains are not in the possession of the Nebraska State Historical \\nSociety either because they were not collected during excavation or \\nbecause they were previously repatriated by the Nebraska State \\nHistorical Society to the Pawnee Tribe of Oklahoma in 1990 and 1991.\\n    The sites represent three cultural phases: Pawnee Phase (1750-\\n1876), Lower Loup Phase (1600-1750), and Itskari Phase (1000-1350). \\nPawnee Phase sites were identified on the basis of historic written \\nrecords. Lower Loup Phase sites were identified on the basis of \\nmaterial cultural continuities with Pawnee Phase sites. Itskari Phase \\nsites were identified on the basis of geographical coincidence with \\nLower Loup and Pawnee Phase sites.\\n    On February 1, 1994, the Nebraska State Historical Society agreed \\nto repatriate the above mentioned unassociated funerary objects to the \\nPawnee Tribe of Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe \\nthat believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these objects \\nshould contact Gail DeBuse Potter, Museum Curator, Nebraska State \\nHistorical Society, P.O. Box 82554, Lincoln NE 68501, telephone: (402) \\n471-4759, fax: (402) 471-3314, within [45 days after publication of \\nthis notice]. Repatriation of the objects to the Pawnee Tribe of \\nOklahoma may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\nDated:\\nDr. Francis P.
