Crowley to the Colorado Historical \\nSociety. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary \\nobjects are present.\\n    Extant documentation indicates that this young Ute woman was slain \\nin 1885; and it is probable that this happened during the Beaver Creek \\nMassacre in June, 1885. According to historical documents and Ute oral \\ntradition, two Weeminuche Ute families were camped on Beaver Creek \\nnorth of Dolores, CO when they were attacked by white American \\nsettlers; resulting in the deaths of six or seven persons, including \\ntwo women. Based on this information, this individual has been \\nidentified as Native American of Ute tribal affiliation.\\n    During the 1940s, human remains representing one individual came \\ninto the possession of Arthur Sutton, the sheriff of Montrose County, \\nCO. The circumstances surrounding the recovery of these human remains \\nare not known. In 1956, Arthur Sutton donated these human remains to \\nthe Colorado Historical Society. No known individual was identified. \\nThe 14 associated funerary objects include fragments of a ``Kentucky\\'\\' \\nor ``Indian\\'\\' rifle; textile fragments from a Navajo blanket and \\npossible ``uniform\\'\\'; and a metal button.\\n    Based on physical examinations conducted by the Federal Bureau of \\nInvestigation in 1946 and associated funerary objects, these human \\nremains have been identified as Native American from the historic \\nperiod. The associated funerary objects are similar to items which have \\nbeen excavated with other known Ute graves in Colorado. Montrose \\nCounty, CO is part of the pre-1900 homeland of the present-day Ute \\nIndian Tribe of the Unitah and Ouray Reservation, specifically the \\nUncompahgre Band (Taveewach).\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Colorado \\nHistorical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the \\nColorado Historical Society have also determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (d)(2), the 14 objects listed above are reasonably believed to \\nhave been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of \\ndeath or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials \\nof the Colorado Historical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains \\nand associated funerary objects and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of \\nthe Southern Ute Reservation, Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain \\nReservation, and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Unitah and Ouray \\nReservation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Southern Ute Indian \\nTribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute \\nMountain Reservation, and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Unitah and Ouray \\nReservation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes \\nitself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects should contact Anne Wainstein Bond, Curator \\nof Material Culture, Colorado Historical Society, 1300 Broadway, \\nDenver, CO, 80203; telephone: (303) 866-4691, before June 28, 1999. \\nRepatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to \\nthe Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Ute \\nMountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, and the Ute Indian \\nTribe of the Unitah and Ouray Reservation may begin after that date if \\nno additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: May 18, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
