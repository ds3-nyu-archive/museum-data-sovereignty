This site was excavated as part of TVA\\'s Cedar Creek Reservoir project by the Alabama Museum of Natural History (AMNH) at the University of Alabama. Excavation commenced after TVA acquired the land encompassing 1FR311 on May 5, 1976, for the Cedar Creek project. Material culture recovered from this site indicates it was primarily occupied during the Middle Woodland Copena phase (AD 100\\xe2\\x80\\x94500). The human remains are of children, juveniles and adults. Most of the human remains were too fragmentary to determine sex. The 105 associated funerary objects are 59 copper beads, 17 pieces of galena, 23 conch shell vessel fragments, three greenstone celts/spades, and three Hillabee schist spades.\\n        From July-August, 1973, human remains representing, at minimum, 81 individuals were removed from the Massey Mound, 1FR520, in Franklin County, AL. This site was excavated as part of TVA\\'s Little Bear Creek reservoir project by the AMNH at the University of Alabama. TVA purchased the land encompassing this site on October 28, 1968.\\n        Site 1FR520 is a mortuary stone mound approximately 30 feet in diameter and two to three feet high situated on a ridge overlooking the confluence of Little Bear Creek and Trace Branch.

The 26 associated funerary objects are one chert biface, 24 fragments of turtle shell, and one bag of mussel shell fragments.\\n        From August-September, 1977, human remains representing, at minimum, 26 individuals were excavated from the Hendrix site, 1FR562, in Franklin County, AL. This site was excavated as part of TVA\\'s Cedar Creek reservoir project by the AMNH at the University of Alabama. TVA purchased the land encompassing this site on July 28, 1976.\\n        Site 1FR562 is a village site that was occupied primarily during the Late Archaic (4000-1000 B.C.) and Middle Woodland Lost Creek phase (A.D. 500-700). The human remains represent adults, juveniles, children and infants. Most of the human remains were too fragmentary to determine sex. The 45 associated funerary objects are two chert cores, one soil sample, 20 red ochre fragments, 10 bone fragments, two bone billets, four antler tine tools, one bone fid, one bone awl, one piece of ground sandstone, two sandstone bowls and one turtle shell fragment.\\n\\n        From November-December, 1972, human remains representing, at minimum, 178 individuals were removed from the Carpenter Mound, 1FR594, in Franklin County, AL.
