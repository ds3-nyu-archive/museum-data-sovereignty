It is not known how or when Mr. Haskins acquired this item. SOHS accession number 704 is one string of 83 pinyon pine nut shells. These pinyon pine nut shells are dark gray in color and are strung on a cord.

The beads were collected by Vinton Beall, a relative of Ms. Strang, but there is no documentation of when these beads were acquired. SOHS accession number 1962.6.7.2 is one lot of loose beads made from glass and one lot of loose beads made from shells. The one lot of glass beads are of many colors: Blue, white, purple, green, and pink. The one lot of shell beads are six white, thin, disk-shaped shell beads.
