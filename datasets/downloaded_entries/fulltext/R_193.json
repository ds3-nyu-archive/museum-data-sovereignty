The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In or around the first decade of the 20th century, 60 cultural items were removed from the Columbia River in the vicinity of the town of Chelan, in Chelan County, WA. The catalog form for these items includes the notation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Urban Fisher found these in an Indian Grave in the Upper Columbia River.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Urban Fisher is found in the 1900 and 1910 Federal Censuses in the town of Chelan, in Chelan County, WA, ages 6 and 16, respectively. In the 1920 Federal Census, Urban Fisher is found in Kelso, in Cowlitz County, WA. At some point between when Mr. Fisher moved to Kelso and 1960, he gave or sold these items to Sanford Lord, a Kelso collector of Native objects. City Directories in our collection indicate Mr. Fisher and Mr. Lord worked together in the Kelso Post Office for over 30 years. On January 4, 1960, Sanford Lord donated the bulk of his collection of Native objects to the Cowlitz County Historical Museum. The 60 unassociated funerary objects consist of short necklace fragments: One containing 7 copper beads and 13 shell beads, one containing 5 copper bead fragments and 3 shell beads, and one containing 3 copper beads and 4 shell beads; and 25 loose copper beads of various sizes.\\n        These items were taken from the Columbia River in the vicinity of Chelan, WA, which falls within the traditional lands of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The determination of the cultural affiliation of the unassociated funerary objects is based upon geographical, archeological, oral tradition, and historical evidences. The unassociated funerary objects described above are consistent with cultural items typically found in context with Native American burials in eastern Washington State and the upper Columbia River. Extensive museum documentation, the general geographic locations of the site, burial patterns, and consultation with the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation verify that the cultural items were removed from the area that is within the aboriginal territory of the Chelan Indians, a constituent tribe of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.\\n        Determinations Made by the Cowlitz County Historical Museum\\n\\n        Officials of the Cowlitz County Historical Museum have determined that:\\n        \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 60 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Bill Watson, Collections Curator, Cowlitz County Historical Museum, 405 Allen Street, Kelso, WA 98626, telephone (360) 577-3119, email watsonb@co.cowlitz.wa.us, by August 27, 2014.
