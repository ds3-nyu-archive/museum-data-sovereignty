The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Onondaga Nation of New York and the Haudenosaunee Standing Committee on Burials and Regulations. \\n        At an unknown time prior to 1960, human remains representing one individual were removed from an unknown location in Clifton Springs, NY, by unknown persons. They were donated to the Palmer School of Chiropractic prior to 1960 by an unknown person. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Museum records and osteological characteristics identify these human remains as Native American. The degree of preservation of these remains indicates a date of burial within the last millennium. Consultation with representatives of the Onondaga Nation of New York indicates that Clifton Springs, NY, is located within the traditional territory of the Onondaga Nation of New York, and indicates that a relationship exists between these human remains and the Onondaga Nation of New York. Officials of the Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History have found it reasonable to affiliate these human remains, based on consultation results, with the Onondaga Nation of New York. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Onondaga Nation of New York. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Onondaga Nation of New York and the Haudenosaunee Standing Committee on Burials and Regulations. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Alana Callender, Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History, Palmer College of Chiropractic, 1000 Brady Street, Davenport, IA 52803, telephone (319) 884-5404, before December 22, 2000. Repatriation of the human remains to the Onondaga Nation of New York may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          \\n          Dated: November 16, 2000. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources, Stewardship, and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 00-29814 Filed 11-21-00; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Palmer Foundation for Chiropractic History, Palmer College of Chiropractic, Davenport, IA ", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.
