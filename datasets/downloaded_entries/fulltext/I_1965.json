No known individual was identified. \\nThe five associated funerary objects are four bags of sherds and one \\nsmall shell pendant.\\n    On the basis of archeological context, architectural, ceramic, and \\nother artifactual evidence, the site represents a Hohokam occupation of \\nthe Classic period (A.D. 1150-1450).\\n    Evidence provided by anthropological, archeological, biological, \\ngeographical, historical, kinship, linguistics, and oral tradition \\nsources was considered in determining the cultural affiliation of these \\nhuman remains and associated funerary objects. Bureau of Reclamation \\nofficials have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(e), the \\npreponderance of the evidence suggests that the historic O\\'odham groups \\n(Ak-Chin Indian Community of the Ak-Chin Indian Reservation, Arizona; \\nGila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, \\nArizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River \\nReservation, Arizona; and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona, \\nincluding the San Xavier District) have a strong cultural affiliation \\nwith the prehistoric Hohokam who occupied the middle Gila Valley and \\nsurrounding areas. Great similarities in settlement patterns, economic \\nsystems, architecture, and material culture point to a close \\nrelationship between the Hohokam and the O\\'odham groups. The O\\'odham \\nwere well established along the rivers and in the deserts when the \\nSpanish first arrived in northern Sonora and southern Arizona.\\n     One of the two Pima moieties claims descent from the Hohokam, \\nwhile the other moiety is said to have descended from the ``emergers,\\'\\' \\nthose who overthrew the Hohokam leaders. Although the O\\'odham belong to \\nthe same linguistic group (Piman) as communities in what is now \\nnorthern Mexico, shared vocabulary and syntax with Yuman language \\ngroups along the Colorado River suggests a long-term history of \\ninteraction that stretches back into prehistoric times in what is now \\nsouthern Arizona.\\n    Evidence also shows the interaction of ancestral Zuni and Hopi \\ngroups with the prehistoric Hohokam. This interaction is indicated by \\nthe presence of trade items, particularly ceramics. Such interaction \\ncontinued into protohistoric and early historic times. In addition to \\ntrade, Hopi and Zuni migration traditions indicate that clans \\noriginating from areas south of the Colorado Plateau joined the plateau \\ncommunities late in prehistoric times. These groups contributed \\nceremonies, societies, and iconography to the plateau groups. Both \\nO\\'odham and Western Pueblo oral traditions indicate that some Hohokam \\ngroups may have left the Salt-Gila River Basin after disastrous floods \\nand social upheaval. These groups traveled north and east, possibly to \\nbe assimilated by the Hopi and Zuni. These ties are reflected in some \\nof the traditional ceremonies maintained as part of the annual \\nceremonial cycle.\\n     The evidence suggests that the Hopi and Zuni are also culturally \\naffiliated with the Hohokam. Their ancestors had trade relationships \\nand other likely interactions with the Hohokam, similar to those found \\nbetween groups in the early historic period. Hopi and Zuni oral \\ntraditions indicate that segments of the prehistoric Hohokam population \\nmigrated to the areas occupied by the Hopi and Zuni and were \\nassimilated into the resident populations.\\n     Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Bureau \\nof Reclamation have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), \\nthe human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a \\nminimum of 480 individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of \\nthe Bureau of Reclamation also have determined that the 3,206 items \\nlisted above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near \\nindividual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the \\ndeath rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Bureau of Reclamation \\nhave determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects and the Ak-Chin Indian Community of the Ak-Chin Indian \\nReservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River \\nIndian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-\\nMaricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; \\nTohono O\\'odham\\n\\n[[Page 9002]]\\n\\nNation of Arizona; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New \\nMexico.\\n    This notice has been sent to the Ak-Chin Indian Community of the \\nAk-Chin Indian Reservation, Arizona; Chemehuevi Indian Tribe of the \\nChemehuevi Indian Reservation, California; Cocopah Tribe of Arizona; \\nColorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, \\nArizona and California; Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Community of the \\nFort McDowell Indian Reservation, Arizona; Fort Mohave Indian Tribe of \\nArizona, California  Nevada; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila \\nRiver Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Pascua Yaqui \\nTribe of Arizona; Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, \\nCalifornia  Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the \\nSalt River Reservation, Arizona; San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San \\nCarlos Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'Odham Nation of Arizona; Tonto \\nApache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache \\nReservation, Arizona; Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian \\nReservation, Arizona; Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai \\nReservation, Arizona; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New \\nMexico.
