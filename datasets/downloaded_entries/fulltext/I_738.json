The Quapaw maintained a presence in the Central Mississippi valley until their removal to northwest Louisiana in 1824 when their lands in the Territory of Arkansas were ceded to the United States. Oral history evidence presented by representatives of The Quapaw Tribe of Indians indicates that the St. Francis River Valley region, which includes Cross and St. Francis Counties, has long been included in the traditional and hunting territory of the Quapaw.
