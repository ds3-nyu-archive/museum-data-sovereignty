The basketry is a coiled weave with white sewing \\nof sumac, mottled sewing of bullrush, and black sewing of an unknown \\nfiber. These items are collectively catalogued as a basketry medicine \\nmortar (Accession 1490; Catalogue number 103496).\\n    In 1923, these items were acquired by the Field Museum from Homer \\nE. Sargent. In 1913, Mr. Sargent purchased these items from Ernest Juan \\nwho collected them at ``San Manuel and Banning.\\'\\' The items are \\naffiliated with the Serrano.\\n    The form of these objects, their source, and the documentation \\nconcerning its acquisition lead the Museum to believe that they \\ncomprise a Serrano medicine mortar. Representatives of the San Manuel \\nMission Band of Indians (Serrano) have verified this identification and \\nhave stated that these objects are needed by traditional Native \\nAmerican religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native \\nAmerican religions by their present-day adherents.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Field \\nMuseum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C), these \\nthree cultural items are specific ceremonial objects needed by \\ntraditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. \\nOfficials of the Field Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 25 \\nU.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these items and the San Manuel Band of \\nMission Indians. Although officials of the Field Museum recognize the \\nsignificant importance of these cultural items to the San Manuel Band \\nof Mission Indians, the Field Museum asserts that it has right of \\npossession of these cultural items. However, the Field Museum is \\nwilling to return the mortar under a compromise repatriation claim.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the San Manuel Band of \\nMission Indians. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these objects should \\ncontact Jonathan Haas, MacArthur Curator of North American \\nAnthropology, Field Museum of Natural History, Roosevelt Road at Lake \\nShore Dr., Chicago, IL 60605; telephone: (312) 922-9410, ext. 641, \\nbefore September 26, 1997. Repatriation of these objects to the San \\nManuel Band of Mission Indians may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\n    The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations \\nwithin this notice.\\nDated: August 14, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
