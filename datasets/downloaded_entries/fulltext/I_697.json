On August 24, 1985, the Coconino County Sherriff\\'s Office conducted an investigation in the area and collected the human remains. On August 26, 1985, an anthropologist examined the remains and concluded that the skeleton was that of a female around 50-55 years of age at death and approximately 5\\'0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to 5\\'2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in stature. The examiner further concluded that the remains are possibly from a Hispanic individual, but are more likely from a Native American person. The examination surmised that the individual may have died of exposure in the 1930s or earlier based on the condition of the remains. On November 14, 1985, the Coconino County Sherriff\\'s Office closed the case and turned the remains over to Northern Arizona University. Later, the remains were moved to the Coconino County Coroner\\'s Office in Flagstaff, AZ. In 2012, the Coconino County Coroner\\'s Office notified the Kaibab National Forest of the remains. The five associated funerary objects are two metal belt buckles, two steel rings, and one lot of fragments of a leather horse halter with brass rivets.\\n        Sherriff\\'s Office detectives and the medical examiner dated the remains to the 1930s or earlier.
