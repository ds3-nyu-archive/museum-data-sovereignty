The human remains were removed by A.O. Soreng and subsequently donated to the Burke Museum in 1941 (Burke Accn. #3183). In 1974, the Burke Museum staff legally transferred elements associated with the individuals to Central Washington University (CWU N). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1939, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from Warm Beach in the Port Susan area in Snohomish County, WA. The human remains were found by a road crew and collected by Hillman Investment Company. The human remains were donated to the Burke Museum in 1939 (Burke Accn. #3101). In 1974, the Burke Museum staff legally transferred elements associated with the individuals to Central Washington University (CWU BM). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Based on cranial morphology, the human remains are Native American. Linguistically, Native American speakers of the northern dialect of the Lushootseed language claim cultural heritage to the Port Susan area in Snohomish County and southern Whidbey Island. Historical and anthropological sources (Hollenbeck 1987, Mooney 1896, Ruby and Brown 1986, Spier 1936, and Swanton 1952) indicate that the Snohomish and Stillaguamish peoples occupied southern Whidbey Island and the Port Susan area. The Indian Claims Commission determined that the aboriginal territory of the Snohomish people includes parts of both locations, albeit not the entirety of both sites. Today, descendants of the Snohomish are represented by the Tulalip Tribes of Washington.
