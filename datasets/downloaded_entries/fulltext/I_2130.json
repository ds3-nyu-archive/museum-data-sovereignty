The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, professional staff in consultation with representatives of the the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma; the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa; the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma; the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska; the Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska; the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma; the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska; the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; the Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Lower Sioux; the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; the Prairie Band Potawatomi Indians, Kansas; the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; and the non-Federally recognized Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Community. \\n        The Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, administers the provisions in the Code of Iowa that provide for any human remains over 150 years old to be reburied in a State cemetery. The Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, has in its possession the human remains of a minimum of 339 Native American individuals from Iowa whose cultural affiliation is unknown. These remains are considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cculturally unidentifiable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under NAGPRA, 43 CFR 10.10 (g). Federal regulations currently preclude disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains absent an overriding legal requirement or a recommendation from the Secretary of the Interior, 43 CFR 10.9 (e) (6). In October 1997, the Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, and the Office of the State Archaeologist Indian Advisory Committee, a group composed of representatives of Native American tribes in and from Iowa, requested permission to rebury 339 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunidentified\\xe2\\x80\\x9d human remains in the possession of the Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, in accordance with Iowa law. The request was supported by the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma, the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska, and the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma. \\n\\n        The request was considered by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee at its January 1998 meeting. The review committee recommended that the Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, rebury the culturally unidentifiable human remains in accordance with Iowa law following consultation with those Federally-recognized tribes and a group seeking Federal recognition that presently or formerly lived in Iowa. On March 3, 1999, the Departmental Consulting Archeologist, writing on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, concurred with the review committee\\'s recommendation regarding the disposition of the 339 culturally unidentifiable human remains according to provisions of the Code of Iowa 263B. Very limited and fragmentary remains of three individuals who were originally listed in the Office of the State Archaeologist, University of Iowa, inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects could not be determined to be Native American, and they will be reburied under the provisions of Iowa law. \\n        Disposition of funerary objects associated with culturally unidentifiable human remains is neither governed by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act nor addressed by Code of Iowa 263B, and no associated funerary objects are included in this notice. \\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing four individuals were recovered from an unknown location in Allamakee County, IA, by an unknown collector.
