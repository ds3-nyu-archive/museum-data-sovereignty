Jackson \\nand Derby Lane. Between 1940 and 1941, these human remains were donated \\nto the Neville\\n\\n[[Page 69650]]\\n\\nPublic Museum by Alex Gauthier and W.C. McClendon. No known individuals \\nwere identified. The seven associated funerary objects include one iron \\nsickle blade, one iron 10-d nail section, one iron spike, two pieces of \\nburned sandstone, and two non-human large mammal bones.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects and the apparent age of \\nthe burials, these individuals have been identified as Native American \\nfrom the Late Historic period. During the Late Historic period, the \\narea of Allouez, WI was occupied primarily by the Menominee Indian \\nTribe.\\n    In 1941, human remains representing 22 individuals were recovered \\nfrom the Gibson Rock Shelter, Brown County, WI by R.L. Hall, W. Wittry, \\nand A. Linck. No accession records exist for these human remains, but \\nthey are believed to have been donated by R.L. Hall, W. Wittry, and A. \\nLinck. No known individual were identified. The minimum of 16 \\nassociated funerary objects include one antler point, one beveled bone \\nknife, a shell bead, turtle plastron ``plaque\\'\\', non-human bones, one \\nbeaver incisor, one snail shell, one stick, and grit-tempered sherds, \\nsome of which form two Aztalan Collared vessels.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects and apparent age of the \\nburials, these individuals have been determined to be Native American. \\nBased on the ceramic types, these burials are estimated to date to the \\nWoodland period. Based on continuities of ceramics and occupation, some \\narcheologists believe the ceramics are associated with ancestors of the \\nMenominee. Although other archeologists believe the ceramics could be \\nassociated with the Ho-Chunk, the museum feels the evidence indicates a \\nprimarily Menominee cultural affiliation.\\n    In 1950, human remains representing 12 individuals were recovered \\nfrom the Charles Grignon House, operated by the Outagamie County \\nHistorical Society, Outagamie County, WI during excavations. In 1953, \\nthese human remains were donated to the Neville Public Museum by \\nWilliam Wolf, then-curator of the Charles Grignon House. No known \\nindividuals were identified. The associated funerary objects were not \\ndonated to the Neville Public Museum. The Neville Public Museum feels \\nthat those objects and additional human remains are the responsibility \\nof the Outagamie County Historical Society and will not attempt re-\\nconstituting the collection for the purpose of repatriation.\\n    Based on analysis of the associated funerary objects, these \\nindividuals have been determined to be Native American from the Late \\nHistoric period. Historic documents (Bishop Kemper\\'s 1834 tour) further \\nestablish an active Menominee cemetery at or very near this site.\\n    In 1980, human remains representing two individuals were recovered \\nfrom an embankment in Green Bay, WI and donated to the Neville Public \\nMuseum by the City of Green Bay Police Department. No known individuals \\nwere identified. The 604 associated funerary objects include glass \\nbeads and small mammal bones.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects and apparent age of the \\nburials, these individuals have been determined to be Native American. \\nFurther, the presence of black seed beads suggests a Late Historic \\nperiod date for the burials. During the Late Historic period, the area \\nof Green Bay, WI was occupied primarily by the Menominee Indian Tribe.\\n    The 30 cultural items consist of a stone pipe bowl, six faceted \\n(cut) blue beads, three dark red beads, four Madison points, two \\nhumpbacked knives, one side-notched point, one bifurcate-base point, 12 \\nfaceted (cut) blue beads, and a string of tiny white and dark red \\nbeads.\\n    In 1923, Mr. Lisle Perizak donated the 12 faceted (cut) blue beads \\nand the string of tiny white and dark red beads to the Neville Public \\nMuseum. In 1925 and 1935, Mr. J.P. Schumacher sold the remainder of the \\ncultural items listed above to the Neville Public Museum.\\n    Museum records state that these 30 cultural items were all removed \\nfrom burials in a mound in Green Bay, WI. Archeological records \\nindicate that historic Menominee burials were located in this mound. \\nThe objects are being affiliated with the Menominee Tribe as they were \\nall removed from a mound with historic Menominee burials.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Neville \\nPublic Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the \\nhuman remains listed above represent the physical remains of 31 \\nindividuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Neville \\nPublic Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(2), the 627 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have \\nbeen placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death \\nor later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Officials of the \\nNeville Public Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(2)(ii), these 30 cultural items are reasonably believed to have \\nbeen placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death \\nor later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a \\npreponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific \\nburial site of an Native American individual. Lastly, officials of the \\nNeville Public Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains, \\nassociated funerary objects, and unassociated funerary objects and the \\nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Ho-Chunk Nation of \\nWisconsin, the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, and the Menominee Indian \\nTribe of Wisconsin. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Ann Koski, Director, \\nNeville Public Museum of Brown County, 210 Museum Place, Green Bay, WI \\n54303; telephone: (920) 448-4460, before January 19, 1999. Repatriation \\nof the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Menominee \\nIndian Tribe may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\nDated: December 8, 1998.\\nVeletta Canouts,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nDeputy Manager, Archeology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 98-33447 Filed 12-16-98; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
