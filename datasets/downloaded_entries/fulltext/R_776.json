Peabody Museum of Archaeology, Phillips Academy, \\nAndover, MA\\n\\nAGENCY: National Park Service\\n\\nACTION: Notice\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection \\nand Repatriation Act, 43 CFR 10.10 (a)(3), of the intent to repatriate \\na cultural item in the possession of the Robert S. Peabody Museum of \\nArchaeology, Phillips Academy which meets the definition of ``sacred \\nobject\\'\\' and ``object of cultural patrimony\\'\\' under Section 2 of the \\nAct.\\n    The item is a clan mask made of buffalo hide, including an arm \\ndecoration with tin tinklers.\\n    In November of 1938, this clan mask was bought from a member of the \\nPueblo of Jemez through Frank C. Hibben and E.F. Goad of the University \\nof New Mexico on behalf of Douglas S. Byers, Director of the Robert S. \\nPeabody Museum.\\n    The cultural affiliation of this clan mask with the Pueblo of Jemez \\nis clear. The mask is known by the religious leaders of the Pueblo of \\nJemez, and museum documentation indicates it is from the Pueblo of \\nJemez. Museum documentation further indicates that the Museum staff \\nwere aware at the time of acquisition this mask\\'s importance to the \\nclan it originated from and of its active role in the religious life of \\nthe community. Consultation evidence presented by representative of the \\nPueblo of Jemez indicates it is needed by traditional religious leaders \\nfor the practice of traditional Native American religion by present-day \\nadherents. Further, representatives of the Pueblo of Jemez have stated \\nthat this mask was not and is not an object which can be alientated by \\nany individual.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Robert \\nS. Peabody Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(3), \\nthis cultural item is a specific ceremonial object needed by \\ntraditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. \\nOfficials of the Robert S. Peabody Museum have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(4), this cultural item has ongoing \\nhistorical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the culture \\nitself, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by \\nany individual. Officials of the Robert S. Peabody Museum have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between this \\nitem and the Pueblo of Jemez.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Pueblo of Jemez. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with this object should contact James W. Bradley, \\nDirector, Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology, Phillips Academy, \\nAndover, MA 01810, telephone (978) 749-4490 before April 23, 1998. \\nRepatriation of this object to the Pueblo of Jemez may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: March 16, 1998.\\n\\n    Francis P.
