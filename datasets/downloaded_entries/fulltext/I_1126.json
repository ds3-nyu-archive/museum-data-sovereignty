The human remains were removed from the Congdon site (45-KL-41), in Klickitat County, WA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Burke Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; and the Nez Perce Tribe, Idaho (hereinafter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The Burke Museum also consulted with the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian group (hereinafter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Indian Group\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        Between 1955 and 1957, human remains were removed from the Congdon site, in Klickitat County, WA, by a University of Washington field party led by Mr. Robert B. Butler. The human remains were transferred to the Burke Museum and formally accessioned in 1966 (Burke Accn.# 1966-100). In 1974, the Burke Museum legally transferred portions of the human remains to Central Washington University. In 2007, a Notice of Inventory Completion (NIC) describing 91 individuals and 1,049 associated funerary objects removed from the Congdon site was published in the Federal Register [72 FR 29177-29178, May 24, 2007]. The Burke Museum and Central Washington University have jointly repatriated all human remains and funerary objects from the Congdon site described in the NIC.\\n        In September 2010, human remains representing at least two individuals were returned to the Burke Museum from the Washington State Physical Anthropologist. These human remains had been turned over to the New York State Police by a private citizen who stated they were among the possessions of her deceased husband. She believed they had been removed from a warehouse in south Seattle sometime before 2000. The human remains have been determined to be from the Congdon site. The remains of one individual were directly labeled with a Condgon site number and the second individual was determined to be from the Congdon site due to the color and appearance of the remains. The return of these remains increases the original minimum number of individuals from the site by two individuals. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Published ethnographic documentation indicates that the Congdon site is in the aboriginal territory of the Western Columbia River Sahaptins, Wasco, Wishram, Yakima, Walla Walla, Umatilla, Tenino, and Skin (Daugherty 1973, Hale 1841, Hunn and French 1998, Stern 1998, French and French 1998, Mooney 1896, Murdock 1938, Ray 1936 and 1974, Spier 1936), whose descendents are represented today by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon. Furthermore, information provided during consultation indicates that the aboriginal ancestors occupying this area were highly mobile, and traveled widely across the landscape for gathering resources as well as trade.
