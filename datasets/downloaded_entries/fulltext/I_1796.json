Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.  The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Sonoma County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3).  The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        An assessment of the human remains, and catalog records and associated documents relevant to the human remains, was made by Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Big Valley Rancheria, California; Cahto Indian Tribe of the Laytonville Rancheria, California; Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California; Dry Creek Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians of the Sulphur Bank Rancheria, California; Guidiville Rancheria of California; Hopland Band of Pomo Indians of the Hopland Rancheria, California; Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria, California; Lytton Rancheria of California; Lower Lake Rancheria, California; Manchester Band of Pomo Indians of the Manchester-Point Arena Rancheria, California; Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Pinoleville Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Potter Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Redwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation, California; Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California; Sherwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; and Upper Lake Band of Pomo Indians of Upper Lake Rancheria of California.\\n        In 1956, human remains representing at least one individual were removed from site CA-Son-5, Sonoma County, CA, by Francis A. Riddell, University of California, Berkeley during archeological fieldwork sponsored by the University of California.  The site is an occupation site located on a bluff south of Santa Rosa Creek, within the historic Cabeza de Santa Rosa land grant at Santa Rosa.  No known individual was identified.  The three associated funerary objects are a stone pestle, a clam shell bead, and an obsidian blade.\\n        The presence of clamshell disc beads with the burial indicates that the burial postdates A.D. 1500.\\n\\n        Based on the manner of burial, the human remains from site CA-Son-5 are determined to be Native American in origin.  Site CA-Son-5 is located in a region that has been occupied by Pomo speakers since approximately 5,000 B.C.  Based on geographical location, age of the burial, and information provided during consultation, the human remains are culturally affiliated with descendents of the Pomo.  The modern day representatives of the Pomo are the Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Big Valley Rancheria, California; Cahto Indian Tribe of the Laytonville Rancheria, California; Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California; Dry Creek Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians of the Sulphur Bank Rancheria, California; Guidiville Rancheria of California; Hopland Band of Pomo Indians of the Hopland Rancheria, California; Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria, California; Lytton Rancheria of California; Lower Lake Rancheria, California; Manchester Band of Pomo Indians of the Manchester-Point Arena Rancheria, California; Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Pinoleville Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Potter Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Redwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation, California; Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California; Sherwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; and Upper Lake Band of Pomo Indians of Upper Lake Rancheria of California.\\n        Officials of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of at least one individual of Native American ancestry.  Officials of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the three objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.  Lastly, officials of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Big Valley Rancheria, California; Cahto Indian Tribe of the Laytonville Rancheria, California; Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California; Dry Creek Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians of the Sulphur Bank Rancheria, California; Guidiville Rancheria of California; Hopland Band of Pomo Indians of the Hopland Rancheria, California; Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria, California; Lytton Rancheria of California; Lower Lake Rancheria, California; Manchester Band of Pomo Indians of the Manchester-Point Arena Rancheria, California; Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Pinoleville Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Potter Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Redwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation, California; Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California; Sherwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California; and Upper Lake Band of Pomo Indians of Upper Lake Rancheria of California.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact C. Richard Hitchcock, NAGPRA Coordinator, Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, telephone (510) 642-6096, before March 4, 2005.
