The human remains were removed during legal excavation on private land. The human remains were accessioned into the museum collection (A533.4A (CUI 28), A533.5C (CUI 29), A533.5B (CUI 30), A533.5A (CUI 31), and A533.6A (CUI 32)). Remains include one child, which was reportedly found with seven associated funerary objects, but only three were collected and in the museum\\'s possession: one small circular slate plaque (A533.4B), one stone metate (A533.7A), and one lot of shell fragments (A533.36). The additional human remains are composed of one infant and three adult males, one with the following associated funerary objects: two lots of pottery sherds (A533.6B, A533.6C), one lot of lithics (A533.6D), and one animal bone fragment (A533.6D).
