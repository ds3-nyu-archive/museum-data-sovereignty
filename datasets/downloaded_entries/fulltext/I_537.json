The first set of human remains was removed from either Albany, Whiteside County, IL or Evanston, Cook County, IL.

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Evanston History Center professional staff in consultation with representatives of Delaware Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska; Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma; Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1878, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from either Albany, Whiteside County, IL (Albany Mounds, site 11WT1) or Evanston, Cook County, IL. Conflicting provenance indicated on inventory tags and lack of accession records complicate the history of these human remains. One document asserts it is the skull of a Native American girl removed from a mound on the upper terrace of hills on the Mississippi river near Albany, IL in 1878 and was donated by F.S.

The fragmented human remains were presented to the Evanston Historical Society in 1929 as part of the C.S. Raddin Collection.
