No further information has been found to clarify means or location of acquisition by the donor.\\n        The Dilzini Gaan headdress is composed of wooden slats arranged in a fan shape measuring approximately 38 inches wide and 23 inches high. The slats are decorated with green, blue, orange, and white paint. Two tassels made of four slender, blue wooden rods are attached to the laterally projecting slats, one tassel on the right side and one on the left side.

According to correspondence found in the museum records, Ms. Gray and a companion unearthed the masks in Arizona from the floor of a deserted Apache cabin during the middle of the night. Museum records identify all four headdresses as Apache \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevil Dance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d material.\\n        The first of the three Dilzini Gaan headdresses is made of wooden slats tied together with sinew arranged in a fan shape measuring approximately 31 inches wide and 35 inches high.

A dark cloth face mask is attached to the frame. The mask measures approximately 18.75 inches in long.\\n        On March 5, 1943, the Southwest Museum received two cultural items from Mr. John W. Ennis, Jr., of Los Angeles, CA. Museum records identify the items as a Western Apache medicine shirt and a medicine bundle composed of a plaque and deerskin bag. According to database records, the two cultural items were originally obtained by a missionary. It is unclear how Mr. Ennis, Jr., came to possess the cultural items. No further information has been found to clarify means or location of acquisition by the donor.\\n        The medicine shirt, or shaman\\'s garment, is a painted deer hide with a scalloped border measuring approximately 25.5 inches wide and 30 inches long. A slit has been cut near the center for the wearer\\'s neck. Black, yellow, and green designs have been painted on both sides of the hide. The medicine bundle is composed of two items.

A deerskin thong and feathers are attached to a center perforation. The second item is a deerskin bag with shoulder strap. The bag measures approximately 9.75 inches wide and 4.75 inches long. A green, black, and yellow figure has been painted on the bag, similar to the one on the wooden plaque. Eight groups of feathers are attached to the bag and along the length of the strap.\\n        On an unknown date, the Southwest Museum purchased two wooden crosses from Mr. Bill Smith with money provided by the General Charles McCormack Reeve Fund. No further information has been found to clarify means of acquisition by the donor.\\n        The first cross is 56 inches high, 33.5 inches across, and .25 inches thick. The cross is composed of five long wooden slats tapered to a point distally, traversed horizontally by five shorter wooden slats. Blue, black, and white zigzagged lines have been painted on the surface. A circular appendage has been attached to the top of the cross. Two dark brown feathers measuring 12 inches in length remain tied to the cross by a cloth cord. The second cross is 52 inches high, 24 inches across, and .25 inches thick. The cross is composed of five long wooden slats tapered to a point distally, traversed horizontally by five shorter wooden slats. Blue, black, and white zigzagged lines have been painted on the surface.\\n        On February 2, 1959, the Southwest Museum acquired one cap from Mr. Julian Adams of Marino, CA, as part of the Mary E. Adams ethnological collection. Museum records identify the cap as Apache. The cap is a man\\'s buckskin cap and exhibits white, black, and dark red beads sewn in a star pattern. Seven eagle feathers are attached to the top. No further information has been found to clarify the means or location of acquisition by the donor.\\n        Consultation and physical inspection of the cultural items described above by knowledgeable Western Apache traditional cultural authorities of the San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona have identified the cultural items as culturally affiliated with Western Apache Indian tribes. According to the traditional cultural authorities, the cultural items have ongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance to the Western Apache, and today, must be returned to the tribes representing the Western Apache to fully complete the ceremonial cycle into which they were introduced; as such, the cultural items are objects of cultural patrimony.\\n\\n        According to Western Apache traditional cultural authorities, the 55 cultural items are made and handled according to instructions received from the Creator. The Creator is the only One who has the right to possess the cultural items after their use by humans. The cultural items must be put away properly to return them to the Creator; as such, the cultural items are sacred objects. The Western Apache are represented today by the federally recognized San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona. These four tribes are members of the Western Apache NAGPRA Working Group.\\n        Officials of the Southwest Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C), the 55 cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. Officials of the Southwest Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(D), the 55 cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual. Lastly, officials of the Southwest Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the objects of cultural patrimony and sacred objects and the San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the objects of cultural patrimony and sacred objects should contact Dr. Duane H. King, Executive Director, or Jamie Hebert, NAGPRA Research Associate for Collections, Southwest Museum of the American Indian, Autry National Center, 234 Museum Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90065, telephone (323) 221-2164 extension 241, before December 4, 2006. Repatriation of the objects of cultural patrimony and scared objects to the San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        Southwest Museum is responsible for notifying the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; San Carlos Reservation, Arizona; Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona; and Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: September 28, 2006.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
