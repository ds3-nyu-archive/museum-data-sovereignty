The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        An assessment of the human remains, and catalog records and associated documents relevant to the human remains, was made by Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento Division professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Big Sandy Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Cold Springs Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California; Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California.\\n\\n        Human remains representing a minimum of one individual removed from site CA-Fre-27 were described in a Notice of Inventory Completion previously published in the Federal Register (70 FR 1267-1268, January 6, 2005). After publication of the notice, the officials of the Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District conducted a further review of the evidence, and found cultural affiliation for the remaining four individuals that had been previously determined to be culturally unidentifiable. \\n        In 1948, human remains were removed from site CA-Fre-27, Fresno County, CA, by F.
