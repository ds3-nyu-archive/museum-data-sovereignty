The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Sometime in the 1960s, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the R.A. Watts site (41CP14) in Camp County, Texas. The individual was excavated by R. L. Turner, an amateur archeologist and private collector. Subsequently (possibly during the 1960s or 1970s when the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University was conducting investigations for the Titus County Fresh Water Supply District No. 1 in Camp County, TX), Turner transferred these human remains to the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University. The burial is labeled Feature 3, Area B. No other information is known about this individual. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Archeologists Timothy L. Sullivan, S. Alan Skinner, and Beverly A. Mitchum have dated the major occupation of the R.A. Watts site to the Titus Focus of the Late Caddo Period (A.D. 1400-1600). The final, published report affiliates this site with the ancestral Caddo. The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma claims Camp County, TX as an area of interest.\\n        In December 1940, human remains representing, at minimum, four individuals were removed from the Whiterock Spillway site (41DL83; also known as 18D7-1 and 27A5-19D5) in Dallas County, TX. The site was excavated by two avocational archeologists, Forrest Kirkland and R. King Harris of the Dallas Archeological Society. R. King Harris worked in the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University and, upon his retirement in 1974, he transferred the remains of these individuals to the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University. Burial 1 contained an adult male, 30-40 years old, with possible healed mandibular infarctions. Burial 4 contained an adult of unknown sex, 18-25+ years old, with no skeletal pathology. Burial 5 contained an adult male, 40+ years old, with no skeletal pathology. This individual has dental caries, and has completely lost the cusps of the premolars and molars. Burial 7 contained an adult male, 25+ years old, with no skeletal pathology. This individual has one dental cavity, and has completely lost the cusps of the premolars and molars. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Archeologists Mark E. Huff, Jr. and Norman Briggs have dated the Whiterock Spillway site to the Wylie Focus of the Middle to Late Caddo Periods (A.D. 1200-1680). The final, published report affiliates this site with the ancestral Caddo. The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma claims Dallas County, TX, as an area of interest.\\n        In 1965, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from the Lower Rockwall Site (41RW1; also known as 27B1-2, RW2) in Rockwall County, TX. The site was excavated by the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University under contract to the National Park Service. The human remains from Burial 1 consist solely of the cranium of a middle-aged female. This grave had been dug into the side of the inward slope of the north rim of a large pit. The skull was found lying on its right side, with the top of the head to the north and the face to the west. Burial 2 contained an adult female, 35-45 years old. This individual lay in a flexed position on the left side, with the head to the west. The head was bent downward with the chin resting on the chest and facing toward the east. The right hand rested on the top of the head, and the left arm was bent across the chest. No description is given for the third individual. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Archeologists Dessamae Lorrain and Norma Hoffrichter date the occupation of the Lower Rockwall site between 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1300, i.e. from the Middle/Late Archaic to the Wylie Focus.
