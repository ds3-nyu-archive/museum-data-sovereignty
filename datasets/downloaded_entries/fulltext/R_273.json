The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In 1930, cultural items were removed from Queen Creek Ruin, also known as Sonoqui Pueblo, Pozos de Sonoqui, or Sun Temple Ruin (AZ U:14:48(ASM)/SACATON:2:6(GP)), in Maricopa County, AZ, during legally authorized excavations conducted by the Gila Pueblo Foundation. The items were reportedly found in association with human burials, but the human remains are not present in the collections. In December 1950, the Gila Pueblo Foundation closed and the collections were donated to the Arizona State Museum. The 30 unassociated funerary objects are 12 ceramic bowls, 8 ceramic jars, 1 ceramic ladle, 3 ceramic pitchers, 5 ceramic scoops, and 1 ceramic sherd.\\n\\n        Queen Creek Ruin was a large habitation site that included trash mounds, burials, pithouses, canals, adobe compounds, and a ballcourt. Architectural features, the mortuary program, ceramic types, and other items of material culture are consistent with the Hohokam archeological tradition and indicate occupation between approximately A.D. 950 and 1450.\\n        \\n        In 1927-1928, a cultural item was removed from the Adamsville site (AZ U:15:1(ASM)/FLORENCE:7:6(GP)), in Pinal County, AZ, during legally authorized excavations conducted by the Gila Pueblo Foundation. The item was reportedly found in association with a human burial, but information to associate the object with a specific burial has not been found. In December 1950, the Gila Pueblo Foundation closed and the collections were donated to the Arizona State Museum. The one unassociated funerary object is a ceramic jar.\\n        The Adamsville site was a large village that included a platform mound, adobe structures, and ballcourts. Architectural features, the mortuary program, ceramic types, and other items of material culture are consistent with the Hohokam archeological tradition and indicate occupation between approximately A.D. 900 and 1450.\\n        In 1973, cultural items were removed from Escalante Ruin (AZ U:15:3(ASM)), in Pinal County, AZ, during legally authorized excavations conducted by the Arizona State Museum under the direction of David Doyel. All collections from this project were accessioned into Arizona State Museum collections in 1976. The items were associated with a human burial, but the human remains are not present in the collections. The two unassociated funerary objects are a stone axe and a quartz polishing stone.\\n        Escalante Ruin was the central habitation site of the Escalante Group Complex. It contained a large platform mound, a compound, and a room block attached to the mound. Architectural features, the mortuary program, ceramic types, and other items of material culture are consistent with the Hohokam archeological tradition and indicate occupation between approximately A.D. 1150 and 1450.\\n        Continuities of mortuary practices, ethnographic materials, and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman) and Puebloan cultures.
