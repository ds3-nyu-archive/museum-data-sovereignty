The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Lower Sioux; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Prairie Island Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Prairie Island Reservation, Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota (Prior Lake); Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota (formerly known as the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe); Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota; Upper Sioux Indian Community of the Upper Sioux Reservation, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. \\n        In 1933, human remains representing three individuals were recovered from an unknown location in Nebraska by an unknown person. The remains were given to Dr. E.B. Renaud, founder of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology, who brought them to the museum. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The physical anthropological characteristics of these remains indicate that they are Native American. The museum\\'s records of Dr. Renaud\\'s research and collecting in Nebraska show that he collected remains only in western Nebraska, making it likely that these remains are from that portion of the state. \\n        In 1933, human remains representing two individuals were recovered from an unknown site in Bridgeport, Morrill County, NE, by Paul Henderson. The remains were given to Dr. E.B. Renaud, of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology, who brought them to the museum. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The physical anthropological characteristics of these remains indicate that they are Native American. \\n        In 1933, human remains representing one individual were recovered from Benkelman, Dundy County, NE, by Dr. E.B. Renaud, of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The physical anthropological characteristics of these remains indicate that they are Native American. \\n\\n        Collections documentation is nonexistent concerning possible dates, cultural affiliation(s), or the circumstances under which these Native American human remains were found. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian Land Areas Judicially Established 1978 Map\\xe2\\x80\\x9d indicates the legal claim to land based upon traditional use for the Southern Cheyenne, Southern Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho, Sioux, and Pawnee. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEarly Indian Tribes, Culture Areas, and Linguistic Stocks Map\\xe2\\x80\\x9d establishes the presence of the Arapaho, Sioux, and Pawnee at the time of contact with Europeans. Representatives of the Pawnee Nation presented oral testimony connecting the Pawnee geographically to western Nebraska. Representatives of seven Sioux tribes presented oral testimony during consultation that placed the Sioux in Nebraska, which was the site of many conflicts. The seven Sioux tribes are the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of six individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2(e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Lower Sioux; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Prairie Island Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Prairie Island Reservation, Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota (Prior Lake); Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota (formerly known as the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe); Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota; Upper Sioux Indian Community of the Upper Sioux Reservation, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of the Crow Creek Reservation, South Dakota; Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule Reservation, South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Lower Sioux; Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Prairie Island Indian Community of Minnesota Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of the Prairie Island Reservation, Minnesota; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Santee Sioux Tribe of the Santee Reservation of Nebraska; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community of Minnesota (Prior Lake); Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota (formerly known as the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe); Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota; Upper Sioux Indian Community of the Upper Sioux Reservation, Minnesota; and Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.
