The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Aransas, Brazoria, Harris, Nueces, and Matagorda Counties, TX.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Texas A&M University (TAMU) professional staff in 1995, and the remains were determined to be ancestral to the historic Coahuiltecan culture. In 2010, representatives of the Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma were invited to consult with TAMU for the purpose of determining the place and manner of the repatriation, but no Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma representatives contacted TAMU or visited the remains in response to this invitation.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In October 1980, human remains representing, at minimum, seven individuals were removed from the Palm Harbor site (41AS80) in Aransas County, TX, during a salvage project at a construction site. At the time of excavation, the co-mingled remains were not given a site burial designation. The human remains were determined to be two adult females, four adult males, and one subadult. The human remains were donated to TAMU in 1980 (TAMU-NAGPRA 17), and the archeologists at the time indicated that these individuals dated to the Late Archaic Period, possibly the Karankawa culture. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Based on geographic location, TAMU staff found it reasonable to trace a shared identity from this site to the historic Coahuiltecan culture. Archeological and linguistic evidence, historical records, and traditional beliefs indicate that there is a relationship of shared group identity between the historic Coahuiltecan culture and the present-day Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\\n        Between October 1987 and February 1988, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Alabonson Road site (41HR273) in Harris County, TX, as part of a CRM project jointly conducted by Texas A&M and Prewitt and Assoc., Inc. The human remains were determined to be as follows: From Burial #1 (TAMU-NAGPRA 31), one adult female; and from Burial #2 (TAMU-NAGPRA 32), one adult female. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects associated with Burial #1 include one lot of fresh water mussel shells found in a circular pattern in chest area, one modified animal bone also found in chest region, and one human canine.
