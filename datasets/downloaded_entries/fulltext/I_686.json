The human remains and a small number of artifacts were accessioned by the Arizona State Museum in 1934. The rest of the artifacts were taken to a private museum in Clarkdale, AZ. After Tuzigoot National Monument was established in 1939, many of the artifacts held by the private museum were transferred to Tuzigoot National Monument. These included some funerary objects that were once associated with human remains that remained under the control of the Arizona State Museum. In 2012, human remains and funerary objects under the control of the Arizona State Museum were transferred to the physical custody of the Western Archeological and Conservation Center.\\n        Collections Under the Control of Tuzigoot National Monument\\n        In 1933 and 1934, human remains were removed from Tuzigoot Pueblo in Yavapai County, AZ. The remains are under the control of the Arizona State Museum and are described below. The 29 associated funerary objects under the control of Tuzigoot National Monument are 15 bowls, 8 pendants, 1 bracelet, 2 necklaces, 1 pitcher, 1 bone tool and 1 matting fragment.\\n        In 1933 and 1934, human remains were removed from Hatalacva Pueblo in Yavapai County, AZ. The remains are under the control of the Arizona State Museum and are described below. The seven associated funerary objects under the control of Tuzigoot National Monument are five bowls, one pendant and one necklace.\\n        Collections Under the Control of the Arizona State Museum\\n        In 1933 and 1934, human remains representing, at minimum, 114 individuals were removed from Tuzigoot Pueblo in Yavapai County, AZ. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects under the control of the Arizona State Museum are one bowl, one lot of shell beads, and one bracelet.\\n        In 1933 and 1934, human remains representing, at minimum, 14 individuals were removed from Hatalacva Pueblo in Yavapai County, AZ. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects under the control of the Arizona State Museum are shell bracelets.\\n        Tuzigoot Pueblo is a large pueblo with more than 100 rooms, which is classified by archeologists as Southern Sinagua, Honanki and Tuzigoot phases. Occupation dates range from A.D. 1125 to A.D. 1425. Hatalacva Pueblo is a small, multi-room pueblo near Tuzigoot National Monument, also classified as Southern Sinagua, Honanki and Tuzigoot phases.\\n        The Ak Chin Indian Community of Maricopa (Ak Chin) Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona comprise one cultural group known as the O\\'odham. Material culture items found at the sites, including associated funerary objects, demonstrate continuity between the people of Tuzigoot and Hatalacva pueblos and the O\\'odham. These items include plain woven textiles, coiled basketry, and twill matting that display similar design motifs and construction styles as historic and contemporary O\\'odham items. Additionally, locally made plainware ceramics are similar in construction and appearance to plainware ceramics made in lands attributed to the Hohokam archeological culture, commonly considered to be ancestral O\\'odham. Consultation with O\\'odham tribes also indicates that oral traditions exist that describe ancestral O\\'odham people living in the Verde Valley.\\n\\n        The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona traces ancestry to Yavapai bands once living in the Verde Valley. Consultation with Yavapai tribes indicates the existence of specific ancestral names for the Tuzigoot and Hatalacva sites and a belief that ancestors lived near the sites. Archeological sites identified as Yavapai have also been found near the Tuzigoot and Hatalacva Pueblos. Material culture items found at Hatalacva and Tuzigoot, including basketry and turquoise pendants, are similar in construction and appearance to historic Yavapai items. Additionally, Hatalacva and Tuzigoot are identified as being within the Yavapai traditional lands.\\n        The Hopi Tribe of Arizona considers all of Arizona to be within traditional Hopi lands or within areas where Hopi clans migrated in the past. Evidence demonstrating continuity between the people of Tuzigoot and Hatalacva Pueblos and the Hopi Tribe includes archeological, anthropological, linguistic, folkloric and oral traditions. Ceramic vessels made only on the Hopi mesas as well as plain woven and painted textiles, coiled basketry, and woven matting demonstrate continuity between Tuzigoot, Hatalacva, and Hopi people. Burial patterns noted at Tuzigoot are also similar in appearance to burials at other ancestral Hopi sites. During consultation, Hopi clan members also identified ancestral names and traditional stories about specific events and ancestral people at each site.\\n        The Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai Reservation, Arizona) traces ancestry to Yavapai bands once living in the Verde Valley. Consultation with Yavapai tribes indicates the existence of specific ancestral names for the Tuzigoot and Hatalacva sites and a belief that ancestors lived near the sites. Archeological sites identified as Yavapai have also been found in and near the Tuzigoot and Hatalacva Pueblos. Material culture items found at Tuzigoot and Hatalacva including basketry, turquoise pendants, and twill matting, are similar in construction and appearance to historic Yavapai items. Additionally, Tuzigoot and Hatalacva are identified as being within the Yavapai traditional lands.\\n        The Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, considers the Verde Valley to be within the migration path of ancestral Zuni people.
