Hubbs, G. Shumway, J.R. Moriarty, and Claude Warren in the course of conducting excavations at the site during the construction of two homes in Scripps Estates. The site dates to the Middle Holocene (between 7,000 and 5,500 B.P.) based on radiocarbon dating. Altogether, 16 burials were uncovered, seven of which were left in situ. In 1959, the collections of the other nine burials were sent to UCLA. Subsequently, the collections from seven of these burials were transferred to the University of California, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, while the collections from Burials 9 and 10 remained at UCLA. The identified human remains from Burials 9 and 10 were reportedly sent to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStanford\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for dating. Despite extensive investigations, at this time, the Fowler Museum at UCLA cannot locate these human remains. The human remains in this notice are fragments that were found with faunal remains. They represent two juvenile individuals of unknown sex and one individual of undetermined age and sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects were identified.\\n        Based on archeological evidence, geographic location, ethnographic information, and oral history evidence, these human remains have been identified as Native American.
