Catalog records and historic documentation indicate that the objects were recovered from a Native American grave and therefore they meet the definition of unassociated funerary objects.

These objects include sixty-seven obsidian spear heads, arrowheads or similar objects; two broken pumice stones marked with red ochre; six bone arrowheads; four broken stone pipes; sixteen dentalium and other shell beads; and thirteen small items including ochre, bone carving fragments, and bone or horn fragments.
