Box 5218 (JFTX-G4-EV), Austin, TX 78763-5218, telephone (512) 782-6813, regarding determinations stated in this notice or to claim the cultural item described in this notice.\\n        \\n          Consultation. TXMF officials and the University of Texas at San Antonio archeologists identified the cultural item and assessed the cultural affiliation of the cultural item at the request of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, and in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        \\n          Information about cultural items. In 2000, archeologists with the Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio removed one ceramic vessel during test excavations at site 41LR152, at the TXMF\\'s Camp Maxey facility in Lamar County, TX.  The vessel was collected from level seven of excavation unit two, 70 centimeters below surface, and was in an upright position with no associated artifacts.  In the report Camp Maxey III Archaeological Testing of 23 Prehistoric Sites, Lamar County, Texas (Mahoney et al 2001), the vessel is described as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfine grog-tempered plain jar, of undetermined type, with a direct rim and a flat lip, and a flat base.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Excavations around the vessel did not indicate any subsurface disturbances that would indicate a burial feature. However, an archeological consultant hired by the TXMF suggested that due to the condition of the vessel, and its depth and vertical orientation, the vessel may have been associated with a burial.  TXMF agreed with the consultant and the conclusion that the vessel meets the definition of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunassociated funerary object\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as defined at 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B).The site from which the cultural item was removed (Camp Maxey) is State and not Federal property.\\n\\n        During a meeting on April 10, 2003, the Caddo NAGPRA representative requested information regarding the ceramic vessel that was removed from site 41LR152 at the TXMF Camp Maxey facility, and which he believed might meet the definition of an unassociated funerary object.Intact ceramic vessels are typically encountered in association with burials and are rarely discovered in other contexts.  The excavation report notes that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe recovery of an intact native ceramic vessel, with a terminal depth of 70cm bs, is a definite anomaly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but concedes that depending upon how long ago the vessel was deposited, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is feasible to assume that the intrusive activity may no longer be discernable in the stratigraphy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mahoney et al 2001).  The TXMF consultant suggested that the vessel may have been associated with a human burial, but that conditions at the site were not conducive to the preservation of human remains. Radiocarbon dates and the absence of stratigraphic evidence for a pit indicate that the vessel is associated with the Woodland period.  The archeological record in northeast Texas provides evidence for cultural continuity between the Woodland period and subsequent Caddo periods.  Williams Plain pottery, which first appeared during the Woodland period, has been discovered in association with later Caddoan pottery; and in the Red River Basin, the production of Williams Plain pottery appears to have continued until the end of the Middle Caddoan period, circa A.D. 1300.  This shared ceramic tradition suggests cultural continuity between the Woodland period inhabitants of the Red River Basin and later Caddo occupants of the basin.\\n          Determination. Under 25 U.S.C. 3005, TXMF officials determined that the one ceramic vessel described above is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and is believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        TXMF officials determined that the unassociated funerary object is culturally affiliated with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        \\n          Notification.
