Hewes excavated the Baldhill site in Barnes County, ND. Human remains, representing a minimum of 72 individuals, were recovered from this site. No known individuals were identified. The 67 associated funerary objects are 1 rodent skull, 1 radius from a rodent, 1 rib from a young deer, 1 tibia/fibula possibly from a rabbit, 9 cranial fragments and 1 part of a mandible of a large mammal, 8 cranial fragments and 1 part of a mandible of a large mammal, 1 piece of unidentified bone from a large mammal, 1 auditory bulla from a medium-sized mammal, 1 talus from a medium-sized mammal, 2 pieces of worked stone, 1 chert flake, 1 bifacial flake, 3 pieces of some kind of pigmented material, 1 phalange from an ungulate, possibly bison or elk, 1 single incisor, probably from an elk, 8 pieces of ribs from a large mammal, 5 caudal vertebrae\\xe2\\x80\\x94tail\\xe2\\x80\\x94from a dog-sized animal, 1 large molar, 2 tarsals from a large mammal, 2 vertebral fragments from a large mammal, 1 piece of unidentified bone from a large mammal, 1 piece of scapula, 1 metatarsal or metacarpal and 1 piece of a humerus from a dog-sized mammal, 4 amphibian bones, 3 bird bones, 1 half of a mandible from either skunk or a mink, 1 calcaneus from either a skunk or a mink, and 1 humerus from large dog or wolf.\\n        On an unknown date, Alfred W. Bowers excavated the Greenshield site in Oliver County, ND. The collection was sent to Faye Cooper Cole at the University of Chicago in 1993. From 1950-1952, the collection was transferred to Indiana University. Human remains, representing a minimum of 34 individuals, were recovered. No known individuals were identified. The 2 associated funerary objects are rodent bones.\\n        On an unknown date, Alfred W. Bowers excavated the Larson site in Oliver County, ND. The collection was sent to Faye Cooper Cole at the University of Chicago in 1993. From 1950-1952, the collection was transferred to Indiana University. Human remains, representing 7 individuals, were recovered. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects.\\n        On an unknown date, Alfred W. Bowers excavated the Motsiff site in Morton County, ND. The collection was sent to Faye Cooper Cole at the University of Chicago in 1993. From 1950-1952, the collection was transferred to Indiana University. Human remains, representing 2 individuals, were recovered. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects.\\n        On an unknown date, Alfred W. Bowers excavated the Sanger Mound site in Oliver County, ND. The collection was sent to Faye Cooper Cole at the University of Chicago in 1993. From 1950-1952, the collection was transferred to Indiana University. Human remains, representing 5 individuals, were recovered. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects.\\n        On an unknown date, Alfred W. Bowers excavated site Ar34 in an unknown County, ND. The collection was sent to Faye Cooper Cole at the University of Chicago in 1993. From 1950-1952, the collection was transferred to Indiana University. Human remains, representing 11 individuals, were recovered. No known individuals were identified. There are 16 associated funerary objects: 1 shell, 1 stone tool, 1 sherd, 1 piece of sandstone, and 12 pieces of chert.\\n\\n        Notes indicate that Sanger Mound, Greenshield, Larson, and Motsiff are culturally affiliated with the Mandan and Arikara tribes. Notes associated with site Ar34 indicate either Arikara or Mandan individuals, likely from Fort Abraham Lincoln. The Mandan had a large village located at the site of Fort Abraham Lincoln. The Baldhill and Devil\\'s Lake sites are likely dated to the Extended Middle Missouri variant (1000-1500 AD).
