An amateur archeologist collected the human remains in 1956 and donated them to the UMMAA in 1964. The human remains are from an adolescent and an adult. It is uncertain how the site was identified or excavated. However, records at the UMMAA indicated there were 3 mounds that had been leveled off, located on a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprairie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between Lyons and Muir, south of the Grand River. The human remains are dated to the Woodland Period (850 B.C.-A.D. 1400) based on the presumption that they were removed from one of the burial mounds noted in the UMMAA\\'s records. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date between 1939 and 1940, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Ament Village site (20VA01) in Van Buren County, MI. Amateur collectors found scattered objects that had emerged from 16 blowholes on the bank of School Section Lake. They reported that weathered bone was found near one of the blowholes. The collections were sent to the UMMAA on March 13, 1941, for identification. On December 9, 1941, museum experts determined some of the bone fragments collected from the site to possibly be human. In 2012, UMMAA staff conducting re-inventory work located a box containing the cremated human remains of an adult that were noted as coming from the Ament Village site. These human remains are calcined, highly weathered, sun-bleached, and show horizontal cracking. No date or time period could be established for the human remains. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Michigan\\n        Officials of the University of Michigan have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on cranial morphology, dental traits, archeological context, and accession documentation.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Federal Claims, the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of The Invited and Consulted Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties, Acts of Congress, or Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of The Invited and Consulted Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains may be to The Invited and Consuled Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Ben Secunda, NAGPRA Project Manager, University of Michigan Office of Research, 4080 Fleming Building, 503 S.
