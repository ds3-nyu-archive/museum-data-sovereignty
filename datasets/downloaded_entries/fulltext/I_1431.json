The human remains were removed from Grant County, OR.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Oregon State Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Burns Paiute Tribe; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; and Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAldrich Mtns south Dayville,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Grant County, OR, by an unknown person. The human remains were donated to the museum by a private donor. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Aldrich Mountains border the upper John Day River Valley.
