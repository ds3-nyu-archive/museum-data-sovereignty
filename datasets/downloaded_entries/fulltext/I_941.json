E. Greengo, of the Department of Anthropology, University of Washington, during the excavation of site 45-SJ-105 on Sucia Island. Kidd does not indicate the discovery of a burial site or human remains in his report, but Kidd specifically notes Sucia Island as \\xe2\\x80\\x9chistoric Lummi territory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Staff at the Burke Museum identified the remains in unmodified level bags in the collection prior to 1996. Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission believes Kidd inadvertently and unknowingly removed these human remains from the site. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In July 1971, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed by a park visitor who inadvertently discovered a burial on Sucia Island at site 45-SJ-306. The remains were exposed by natural erosion. The San Juan County Sheriff\\'s Department sent the remains to the Department of Anthropology, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, for identification. Prior to 1993, this collection was released back into the custody of Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. Anthropologists that reviewed the human remains indicated there was an extended postmortem interval and the human remains are consistent with archaeological material. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests Native American groups, specifically the Lummi people, occupied Sucia Island prior to European contact (Amos 1978; McDonald 1990; Stern 1934, Stolpe 1972, Suttles 1951, 1954, 1990). The Lummi Tribal Historic Preservation Officer confirmed Sucia Island as one among many islands in the San Juan archipelago that was occupied by the Lummi people prior to and during the early stages of European contact and settlement in the area.
