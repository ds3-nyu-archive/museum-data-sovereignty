The pipe is large, measuring approximately 20.0 cm high and 14.5 cm wide.\\n\\n        In 1924, Louis Shotridge, a Tlingit Curator employed by the University of Pennsylvania Museum, purchased the eight objects as part of a collection of 49 objects, which are represented by 38 catalogue numbers, referred to as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSnail House Collection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for $500.00 from a Tlingit individual, Archie White (Dimitri Tukk\\'axaaw), the Mt. Fairweather/Snail House headmaster of the T\\'akdeintaan Clan of Hoonah, AK, for the collections of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.\\n\\n        The cultural affiliation of the eight cultural items is with the Tlingit T\\'akdeintaan Clan of Hoonah, AK, as indicated through museum records, and by consultation evidence presented by the Hoonah Indian Association, a Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, and the Huna Heritage Foundation, a non-Federally recognized Indian group, acting on behalf of the Huna Totem Corporation and the Tlingit T\\'akdeintaan Clan of Hoonah, AK.\\n        Based on consultation, museum documentation, anthropological literature, and expert opinion, six of the cultural items are considered to be sacred objects, one is considered to be an object of cultural patrimony, and one is considered to be both an object of cultural patrimony and sacred object. The six cultural items that are sacred objects are the two carved wooden masks (NA6831 and NA6832); the headdress (NA6835); the head cover (NA6836); the carved wooden rattle (NA6845); and the carved wooden pipe (NA6862). The cultural item that is considered an object of cultural patrimony is the wooden box drum (NA6828). Lastly, the cultural item that is considered to be both a sacred object and an object of cultural patrimony is the hide robe (NA6829).\\n\\n        Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), seven cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology also have determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), two cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual. Lastly, officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and the objects of cultural patrimony and the Hoonah Indian Association, a Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, and the Tlingit T\\'akdeintaan Clan of Hoonah, AK.\\n\\n        Representatives of any other Indian Tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the sacred objects and/or objects of cultural patrimony should contact Dr. Richard Hodges, Director, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 3260 South St., Philadelphia, PA 19104-6324, telephone (215) 898-4050, before January 13, 2011. Repatriation of the sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony to the Hoonah Indian Association, a Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, and the Tling\\xc3\\xadt T\\'akdeintaan Clan of Hoonah, AK, may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology is responsible for notifying the Hoonah Indian Association, a Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, and the Huna Heritage Foundation, a non-federally recognized Indian group, that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: December 7, 2010.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 2010-31285 Filed 12-13-10; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4312-50-P\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service", "dep_doc": "[2253-665]", "subject": "Notice of Intent To Repatriate Cultural Items: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia, PA", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.", "action": "Notice.", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Dated: December 7, 2010.", "signature_name": "Sherry Hutt,", "signature_title": "Manager, National NAGPRA Program.
