The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Division of Archaeology, professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1977, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Carter Mansion site (40CR5) in Carter County, TN, by personnel of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology. The Carter Mansion site in Elizabethton, TN, is comprised of the late 18th century home and grounds of John and Landon Carter. Archeological investigations conducted during the 1970s by the Tennessee Division of Archaeology (TDOA) revealed prehistoric and protohistoric Native American components near the structure and along the grounds. The TDOA discovered the human remains and associated funerary objects during a structure restoration project (Smith 1979). During the course of excavation along the front exterior of the house, a burial pit containing the human remains was encountered immediately adjacent to the foundation base. The human remains and associated funerary objects have been curated by the TDOA since excavation. The human remains represent an adult male approximately 20-30 years old. No known individual was identified. Based on analysis of the associated funerary objects, the human remains were considered to be of a protohistoric Native American component. The 580 associated funerary objects are 381 marine gastropod beads; 164 marginella shell beads; 1 leptoxis shell bead; 5 bone beads; 2 Busycon shell ear pins; 2 split turkey bone pins; 15 Busycon shell beads; 1 pounded copper sheet; 1 fragmented woven bark matting (for copper sheet); 1 ceramic platter/bowl with rim notching on one side; 1 miniature incised ceramic vessel; 1 basal portion of an incised ceramic vessel; 1 smooth stone; 3 lithic debitage; and 1 pumpkin seed.
