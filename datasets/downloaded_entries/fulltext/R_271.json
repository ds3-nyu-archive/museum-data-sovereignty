The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In the summer of 1965, 1 lot of unassociated funerary objects were removed from burial unit 8 at the Westmoreland-Barber site, 40MI11, in Marion County, TN. The Westmoreland-Barber site is located at river mile 429 on the Tennessee River. Archeological excavations at Westmoreland-Barber were stimulated by the TVA\\'s construction of the Nickajack Dam and the impending inundation of the resulting reservoir. In August 1964, the University of Tennessee (UT) under the direction of J.B. Graham and under contract with the National Park Service (NPS), excavated sites located within the confines of the proposed Nickajack Reservoir, including site 40MI11. A second season of excavations by UT took place from June 29 to August 18, 1965, at the Westmoreland-Barber site, under a contract with the NPS. The excavation of burial units 5 through 17 took place after the TVA completed the process of purchasing the land tracts where the burial units are located.\\n\\n        One historic burial, burial unit 8, was excavated during the second season. Although disturbed by agricultural plowing, UT archaeologists concluded at the time that the individual in the burial was laid to rest around 1775 and the remains were likely associated with the historically known 18th century Cherokee Lower Town occupation in this area. The human remains from burial unit 8 are no longer present in the McClung Museum. As these remains are no longer in the possession of the TVA or the McClung Museum, the funerary objects from burial unit 8 are now considered unassociated. These objects include 1 string of glass beads (approximately 329 beads), 1 string of tubular shell beads (approximately 39 beads), approximately 5 silver rings or spirals, approximately 6 silver cones or tinklers, 1 shell spoon, 40 ceramic sherds, 1 chert scraper, 5 utilized chert flakes, and 12 unutilized chert flakes.\\n        Determinations Made by the TVA and the McClung Museum\\n        Officials of the TVA and McClung Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), 1 lot of cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects above and the Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; and the United Keetowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary objects should contact Dr. Thomas O.
