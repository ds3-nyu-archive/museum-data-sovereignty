The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Indiana University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (previously listed as the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo of Texas); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. The following tribes were contacted but did not participate in consultations: Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo); Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico, & Utah; Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of San Juan); Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; and Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1963, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from Cottonwood Gulch in McKinley County, NM. The human remains were uncovered between the towns of Thoreau and Gallup during the 1963 Prairie Trek sponsored by the Indianapolis Children\\'s Museum. The human remains were transferred to Indiana University in 1985. No known individuals were identified. The 23 associated funerary objects are 20 pottery sherds and 3 dog bones. Notes indicate that Cottonwood Gulch is affiliated with Puebloan culture and that it is assigned to the Anasazi III cultural phase. The more recently utilized term for Anasazi is Ancestral Puebloan. Ancestral Puebloan culture spread from the Four Corners region to areas of northwestern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah. Major Puebloan cultural periods are marked by territorial expansions and the development of multi-room structures along the edges of canyons or on mesa tops.\\n        In 1947, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from Mimbres River in an unknown county, NM. The human remains were gifted to Indiana University by CP Hogeboom as part of a larger donated collection. Notes infer that the human remains are from a location within the Mimbres Valley in southwestern New Mexico. Within the Mimbres Valley, the primary cultural group was the Mogollon, which emerged from a Desert Archaic tradition. Contemporary Puebloan groups claim affiliation with the Mogollon culture, which is characterized by the use of sophisticated pottery types, the use of kivas for religious and social purposes, and the construction of cliff dwellings. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the New Mexico Pueblo site in an unknown county, NM. The human remains were part of a collection donated to the Department of Anthropology at Indiana University on an unknown date by Mrs. George Ball of Cleveland, Ohio. No known individuals were identified. There are no associated funerary objects.\\n        Evidence demonstrating cultural continuity between Ancestral Puebloan and modern day Puebloan tribes includes geographical, archaeological, historical, architectural, and oral traditions. These descendants are members of the present day tribes of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona ; Kewa Pueblo, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of Santo Domingo); Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico (previously listed as the Pueblo of San Juan);
