The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural item. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item\\n        Between 1895 and 1915, a headdress made from cotton cord, red woolen fabric, and feathers came into the possession of Francis (Frank) Ammann, Sr., who was a baker and operated a dry goods store in Needles, CA. Upon his death, the headdress passed to his son, Dr. F.X. Amman, Jr., who donated the headdress to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History in 1934. In 2002, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History lent the headdress to the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California for exhibition, where it remains today.\\n\\n        Based on research and consultation with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California, and other Chemehuevi elders and scholars of Chemehuevi culture and history, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History has determined that the headdress is possibly the most complete example currently known of a Kaitcoxo. Kaitcoxo headdresses are important objects worn in Chemehuevi traditional religious and tribal ceremonies. The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History also has determined that, in accordance with traditional Chemehuevi practice, an object of this importance to the group as a whole could not have been alienated by any individual. The research also leads the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History to believe that a preponderance of the evidence indicates that this Kaitcoxo came into the hands of Mr. Amman, Sr., from one or more Chemehuevi persons, who were trading with Mr. Amman, Sr., between 1895 and 1915 while he was operating his bakery and store in Needles, CA. For the Chemehuevi people, this was a period of dislocation, successive moves, and removal to reservations.\\n        The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History\\'s consultations included communication with the three Federally-recognized Chemehuevi tribes: Chemehuevi Indian Tribe of the Chemehuevi Reservation, California; Colorado River Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, Arizona and California; and Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California. On July 31, 2015, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History received a letter dated March 31, 2015, and signed by the tribal chairmen of all three Federally-recognized Chemehuevi tribes stating the three tribes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithout exception, enter into this agreement with full consensus, that it is our stated and formal request that the Chemehuevi Headdress . . . be repatriated . . . to the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        Determinations Made by the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History\\n\\n        Officials of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History have determined that:\\n        \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the single Kaitcoxo described above is a specific ceremonial object needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In addition, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the single Kaitcoxo described above has ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the single Kaitcoxo and the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe not identified in this notice that wish to claim this cultural item should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to James R.
