Consultation was also conducted with the \\nPokanoket Tribe of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized \\nIndian group).\\n    In 1914, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom Burr\\'s Hill, Warren, RI by Charles R. Carr, director of the George \\nHail Library, Warren, RI. These human remains were placed within the \\nCharles Whipple Greene Museum within the Library. No known individual \\nwas identified. The 90 associated funerary objects include pipes, metal \\nwork, bottles, wampum, and beads.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects, this individual has been \\nidentified as Native American. Burr\\'s Hill is believed to be located on \\nthe southern border of Sowams, a Wampanoag village. Sowams is \\nidentified in historical documents of the 16th and 17th centuries as a \\nWampanoag village, and was ceded to the English in 1653 by Massasoit \\nand his eldest son Wamsutta (Alexander). Based on the associated \\nfunerary objects, tese human remains have been dated to the contact \\nperiod (1500-1690 A.D.).\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Charles \\nWhipple Greene Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Charles \\nWhipple Greene Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(2), the 90 objects listed above are reasonably believed to \\nhave been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of \\ndeath or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials \\nof the Charles Whipple Greene Museum have determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains \\nand associated funerary objects and the Wampanoag Repatriation \\nConfederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head, the \\nMashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), and the \\nAssonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognized Indian \\ngroup).\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Wampanoag \\nRepatriation Confederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay \\nHead, the Mashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), \\nand the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally \\nrecognized Indian group). Representatives of any other Indian tribe \\nthat believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects should contact Sarah Weed, \\nDirector, George Hail Library, 530 Main Street, Warren, RI 02885; \\ntelephone: (401) 245-7686 before December 9, 1999. Repatriation of the \\nhuman remains and associated funerary objects to the Wampanoag \\nRepatriation Confederation, representing the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay \\nHead, the Mashpee Wampanoag (a non-Federally recognized Indian group), \\nand the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation (a non-Federally recognizd \\nIndian group) may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\nDated: October 25, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
