The human remains were removed from Uyak Bay, Kodiak Island, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Field Museum of Natural History professional staff in consultation with professional staff of the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository, Kodiak, AK, on behalf of Koniag, Inc. and Native Village of Larsen Bay.\\n        In 1967, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the vicinity of Uyak Bay, Kodiak Island, AK, by Kenneth G. McQuin, who donated them to the Field Museum of Natural History that same year (Field Museum of Natural History accession number 2983, catalog number 193459). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains have been identified as Native American based on specific cultural and geographic attributions in Field Museum of Natural History records. The records identify the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKoniag Eskimo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUyak Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Koniag Eskimo - a term used by anthropologists to refer to both the late prehistoric and historic Native peoples of the Kodiak region - are the ancestors of the contemporary Kodiak Alutiiq people. Specifically, the human remains are from an area of the Kodiak archipelago traditionally used by shareholders and citizens of Koniag, Inc. and Native Village of Larsen Bay.\\n        Officials of the Field Museum of Natural History have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Field Museum of Natural History also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and Koniag, Inc. and Native Village of Larsen Bay.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Helen Robbins, Repatriation Director, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605-2496, telephone (312) 665-7317, before June 25, 2009.
