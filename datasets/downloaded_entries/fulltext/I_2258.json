Wright Museum, \\nJamestown, RI.\\n    A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Sydney L. \\nWright Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives \\nof the Narragansett Indian Tribe.\\n    During 1966-1967, human remains representing 36 individuals were \\nexcavated from the West Ferry site by Dr. William Simmons. No known \\nindividuals were identified. The 173 associated funerary objects \\ninclude ceramics, glass beads, tools, cooking utensils, jewelry, \\nthimbles, iron trade artifacts, brass plates, projectile points, powder \\nhorns, cloth fragments, and matting fragments.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects, these individuals have \\nbeen identified as Native American. Based on manner of interment and \\ntypes of associated funerary objects, the West Ferry site has been \\nidentified as a historic Narragansett burial site and ancestral \\nNarragansett burial site. The presence of red ochre and bowls in both \\nthe historic and Archaic burials indicate continuities of tradition \\nthrough time.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Sydney \\nL. Wright Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), \\nthe human remains listed above represent the physical remains of 36 \\nindividuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Sydney L. \\nWright Museum have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(2), the 173 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have \\nbeen placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death \\nor later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of \\nthe Sydney L. Wright Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects and the Narragensett Indian Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Narragansett Indian \\nTribe. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects should contact Stephen C. Baker, Sydney L. Wright \\nMuseum, Jamestown Philomerian Library, 26 North Road, Jamestown, RI \\n02835-1438; telephone: (401) 423-7281, before October 29, 1999. \\nRepatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to \\nthe Narragansett Indian Tribe may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: September 24, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
