The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In 1990 and 1991, 631 cultural items were removed from Mar Lado I (CA-SDI-5130, CA-SDI-5133H, and CA-SDI-6014), in San Luis Rey, San Diego County, CA. Excavations as part of the San Luis Rey River Flood Control Project were conducted by INFOTEC Research, Inc. under a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers (COE). The primary site, SDI-5130, dates to La Jollan or Millingstone times. A subdivision of the site, SDI-5133H, contains a historic component dating to A.D. 1870-1890. No cultural items from two other subdivisions, SDI-6014 and SDI-6015, are included in this notice. As COE decided that the archeological materials from Mar Lado I were not under its control, the collections were received by the Fowler Museum in May 1991.\\n        Documentation indicates that 189 funerary objects were collected from two of four burials located during excavations at the primary site (SDI-5130)\\xe2\\x80\\x94Burial 2 (located in 1990) and Burial 5 (located in 1991). The human remains from Burial 2/Feature 103 were reburied in situ. The 13 funerary objects from Burial 2/Feature 103 include one core, six stone flakes, four pieces of faunal bone, one metate, and one metate fragment. The human remains from Burial 5/Feature 114 were removed by Rose Tyson (San Diego Museum of Man) for analysis on May 23, 1991 and were not accessioned at UCLA. [Note: these human remains may, in fact, have been part of Burial 2/Feature 103, which was very disturbed.] The 176 funerary objects from Burial 5/Feature 114 include 92 pieces of debitage, eight stone tools, 73 animal bone fragments, two shell beads, and one shell bead blank.\\n        Documentation indicates that 442 funerary objects were collected from Burial 3/Feature 2 during excavation in 1990 at CA-SDI-5133H, the historic component within the boundaries of SDI-5130. The human remains from Burial 3/Feature 2 were left in situ (per UCLA\\'s documentation, these human remains are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith Rose Tyson\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The 442 funerary objects include 435 pieces of animal bone, one ceramic sherd, and six ceramic plate fragments.\\n        Determinations Made by the Fowler Museum at University of California Los Angeles\\n        Officials of the Fowler Museum at University of California Los Angeles have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 631 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the La Jolla Band of Luiseno Indians, California (previously listed as the La Jolla Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the La Jolla Reservation); Pala Band of Mission Indians (previously listed as the Pala Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pala Reservation, California); Pauma Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pauma & Yuima Reservation, California; Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pechanga Reservation, California; Rincon Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Rincon Reservation, California; and the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians, California, hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Wendy G.
