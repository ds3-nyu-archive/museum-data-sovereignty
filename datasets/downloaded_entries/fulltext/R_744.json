In 1985, William Claflin donated these nine cultural items \\nto the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.\\n    Between 1915-1929, two of these cultural items were recovered from \\nPecos Pueblo by Alfred Vincent Kidder under the auspices of Phillips \\nAcademy, Andover, MA. In 1936, Phillips Academy donated these two \\ncultural items to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.\\n    Excavations records indicate that the human remains with whom these \\neleven cultural items were associated were not collected. Based on the \\nceramic types recovered from this site, Pecos Pueblo was occupied into \\nthe historic period (1300-1838). Historic records document occupation \\nat the site until 1838 when the last inhabitants left the Pueblo and \\nwent to the Pueblo of Jemez. In 1936, an Act of Congress recognized the \\nPueblo of Jemez as a ``consolidation\\'\\' and ``merger\\'\\' of the Pueblo of \\nPecos and the Pueblo of Jemez; this Act further recognizes that all \\nproperty, rights, titles, interests, and claims of both Pueblos were \\nconsolidated under the Pueblo of Jemez.\\n    Further evidence supporting a shared group identity between the \\nPecos and Jemez pueblos emerges in numerous aspects of present-day \\nJemez life. The 1992-1993 Pecos Ethnographic Project (unrelated to \\nNAGPRA) states: ``[T]he cultural evidence of Pecos living traditions \\nare 1) thet official tribal government position of a Second Lieutenant/\\nPecos Governor; 2) the possession of the Pecos Pueblo cane of office; \\n3) the statue and annual feast day of Porcingula (Nuestra Senora de los \\nAngeles) on August 2; 4) the Eagle Watchers\\' Society; 5) the migration \\nof Pecos people in the early nineteenth century; 6) the knowledge of \\nthe Pecos language by a few select elders.\\'\\' (Levine 1994:2-3)\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Peabody \\nMuseum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these eleven cultural items are reasonably \\nbelieved to have been placed with or near individual human remains at \\nthe time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and \\nare believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed \\nfrom a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials \\nof the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have also determined \\nthat, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared \\ngroup identity which can be reasonably traced between these items and \\nthe Pueblo of Jemez.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Apache Tribe of \\nOklahoma, the Comanche Tribe of Oklahoma, the Hopi Tribe, the Jicarilla \\nApache Tribe, the Kiowa Tribe, the Mescalero Apache Tribe, the Navajo \\nNation, Pueblo of Cochiti, the Pueblo of Jemez, Pueblo of Santo \\nDomingo, the Pueblo of Zuni, and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Barbara \\nIssac, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and \\nEthnology, 11 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, MA 022138; telephone (617) 495-\\n2254, before May 14, 1999. Repatriation of these objects to the Pueblo \\nof Jemez may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\nDated: April 8, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
