The human remains were excavated from the northeast corner of the 1840s adobe while in the process of installing a four-inch wide drain pipe at a depth of 20-30 cm around the perimeter of the building. The firm that conducted the excavation initially identified all of the materials removed from the site as belonging to a medium to large unidentified mammal. Subsequently, the Dana Adobe Nipomo Amigos consulted with an osteologist to confirm that all materials in its possession were non-human. In the process, eight fragments were identified as one adult human, over the age of 20, and probably a female, while a ninth fragment was identified as likely of human origin. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Archeological evidence shows that the geographical area where the site is located has seen aboriginal activity for over 11,000 years, as evidenced by the recovery of a fluted point within the viewshed. In addition, ethnographic evidence identifies the Chumash as having occupied the area. Based on evidence provided by postmortem damage, these human remains predate the 1839-1840 construction of the Dana Adobe.\\n        Determinations Made by the Dana Adobe Nipomo Amigos\\n        Officials of the Dana Adobe Nipomo Amigos have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians of the Santa Ynez Reservation, California.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Donna L.
