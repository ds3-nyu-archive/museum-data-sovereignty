In 1985, Mr. \\nRobbins donated these items to the Robbins Museum of Archaeology.\\n    Based on continuities of material culture and manner of interments, \\nthe Wampanucket site has been identified as a Wampanoag cemetery area \\nused from the early Woodland period into the early postcontact period. \\nConsultation with representatives of the Wampanoag Repatriation \\nConfederacy indicate these cultural items are consistent with \\ntraditional Wampanoag burial practices.\\n    Officials of the Robbins Museum of Archaeology have determined \\nthat, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these two cultural items are \\nreasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human \\nremains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or \\nceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have \\nbeen removed from a specific burial site of an Native American \\nindividual. Officials of the Robbins Museum of Archaeology have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nitems and the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederacy on behalf of the \\nWampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah).\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Wampanoag \\nRepatriation Confederacy on behalf of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head \\n(Aquinnah).
