Nadeau. The human remains, consisting of one adult metacarpal, and the associated funerary objects were donated to the Museum of Natural History and Planetarium, Roger Williams Park, by Mr. and Mrs. Nadeau on January 23, 1933. No known individuals were identified. The 16 associated funerary objects include 1 polished tip of a white-tailed deer antler, 1 partial white-tailed deer antler, 9 partial white-tailed deer bones, 1 piece of a spiny softshell turtle carapace, and 4 potsherds. Most of the objects were labeled as being from Miller Cave, Pulaski County, MO.\\n        The human remains and associated funerary objects were part of a collection of 50 lots of American Indian objects and geological specimens collected in the 1920s by the Nadeaus. No records related to this donation have been located.\\n\\n        The human remains and associated funerary objects were accessioned (catalog number E2730, accession number 8943) and stored with objects collected in 1927 from North Carolina and Young County, Texas. The objects from North Carolina and Texas were labeled according to their provenience.

A 1983 study identified the human remains as American Indian based on the associated funerary objects. Following an examination by representatives of The Osage Nation (previously listed as the Osage Tribe) in January 2016, The Osage Nation and the Museum of Natural History and Planetarium, Roger Williams Park concurred that the human remains and associated funerary objects are from a burial site located on Osage ancestral lands.\\n        Determinations Made by the Museum of Natural History and Planetarium, Roger Williams Park\\n        Officials of the Museum of Natural History and Planetarium, Roger Williams Park, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 1 individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 16 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and The Osage Nation (previously listed as the Osage Tribe).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Michael W.
