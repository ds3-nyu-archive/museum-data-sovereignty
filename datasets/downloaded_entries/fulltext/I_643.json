The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects was made by State Archaeological Research Center and Omaha District professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Human remains that were excavated from Akichita Site (39BF0221) are presently located at the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center (SARC).\\n        In 1962, human remains representing, at minimum, four individuals were removed from the historic component of the Akichita site (39BF221) in Buffalo County, SD. The human remains were collected during a salvage excavation at the site under the direction of Robert Gant, State Archaeological Commission, Vermillion, SD. The human remains and funerary objects were transported to the Commission\\'s office at the W.H. Over Museum, Vermillion, SD.\\n        In 1974, the collections were transferred to the newly established SARC. The human remains were then transferred to the University of Tennessee-Knoxville to be inventoried by Dr. William Bass.\\n        When the human remains were returned to the SARC in the 1980s, what was believed to be all of the human remains were repatriated to Frank Fools Crow, Oglala Lakota Nation.\\n        In 1999, SARC conducted a review of the remaining 39BF221 collection and located fragments of human remains from these burials along with 95 funerary objects. These additional human remains are from all four individuals, an adult male, two children, and an infant. No known individuals were identified. The associated funerary objects are 2 lots of white shell tubular wampum beads; 7 white glass tubular beads; 2 pieces of textile; 4 fragments of red silk ribbon; 1 fragment of fabric with glass beads attached; 2 unmodified faunal bones; 3 lots of wood coffin planking and wood coffin fragments; 25 metal coffin nails; 2 secondary flakes; 7 fragments of shoe leather; 39 brass oval hawk bells with textile fragments; and 1 incomplete china doll (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrozen Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x9d doll).\\n        The human remains were collected from coffin burials in the historic component of the site. The human remains are determined to be Native American based on the associated burial objects and history of the site as associated with a Native American cemetery. The funerary objects associated with the burials, as well as the types of nails used for the coffins, dates the burials between 1860 and 1890. It is likely the Akichita site is associated with the historic Native American cemetery near the old townsite of Fort Thompson. This townsite and cemetery was occupied beginning around 1866. Between 1866 and 1890, the Yanktonai tribe was the majority population in the area, and the cemetery near Fort Thompson is associated with the Yanktonai.
