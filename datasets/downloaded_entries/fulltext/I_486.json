Although the circumstances of discovery and the date of removal are unknown, the human remains were found with a collection that was obtained during excavations conducted by the University of Arizona from 1931 to 1936 under the direction of Byron Cummings at Kinishba, AZ V:4:1(ASM). The collections were accessioned by the Arizona State Museum in 1936. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The cave is described as having both Ancestral Pueblo and Apache components.
