These human remains were removed by Charles Owen, Assistant Curator of Archaeology at The Field Museum, at some point during his two collecting trips to the reservation in 1901 and 1903. No further provenience or dating information is available. The human remains belong to a child of indeterminate sex between the ages of six and ten. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In October 1903, human remains representing at minimum eight individuals were removed from a cave site on the East Fork of the White River, 8 miles north of Fort Apache on the Fort Apache Reservation in Arizona, and were accessioned by The Field Museum. These human remains were removed by Charles Owen, Assistant Curator of Archaeology at The Field Museum, at some point during his two collecting trips to the reservation in 1901 and 1903. While there is historical information about known cave systems and archaeological work undertaken on the White River, including Owen\\'s for The Field Museum, it is not possible to ascertain from which cave in particular the human remains and associated funerary objects were removed. The cranial human remains present (which have been used to determine the number of individuals) belong to two individuals over the age of 50, one male and one indeterminable, two possible females aged 35 or older, a possible female between the ages of 20 and 40, and three children between the age of four and six, eight and ten, and eight and twelve, respectively. The post-cranial human remains present are commingled and do not necessarily represent additional individuals. The human remains represent both juvenile/young adult and adult persons. No known individuals were identified. The four associated funerary items are one piece of unidentified tubular organic material, one piece of twisted fibers, one piece of plant fiber wrapped with bird feather stem, and circular shell or stone beads on twine. \\n        Determinations Made by The Field Museum of Natural History\\n        Officials of The Field Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on Field Museum records and a physical inventory of the collection.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of a minimum of nine individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the four objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (15), the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the tribal land of the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects may be to the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Helen Robbins, Repatriation Director, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 S.
