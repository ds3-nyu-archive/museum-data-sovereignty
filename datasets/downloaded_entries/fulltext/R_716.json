The human remains recovered with these cultural items have previously been repatriated from the Danish National Museum. Based on archeological evidence, the Palugvik Village site has been dated to c. 1500 A.D.\\n        The three cultural items consist of a string of glass beads and two shell pendants.\\n        In 1933, these three cultural items were recovered with a burial at Glacier Island, AK during excavations conducted under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum by Frederica de Laguna. The human remains recovered with these cultural items have previously been repatriated from the Danish National Museum. Based on archeological evidence, this Glacier Island burial has been dated to the post-contact period, post-1780 A.D.\\n        In 1953, the cultural items mentioned above were sent to the University of Alaska Museum from the University of Pennsylvania Museum as part of an exchange collection.\\n        Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the U.S. Forest Service have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), these five cultural items are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual. Officials of the U.S. Forest Service have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the Chugach Alaska Corporation.\\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Chugach Alaska Corporation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these objects should contact Linda Yarborough, Acting Forest Archaeologist, Chugach National Forest, 3301 C Street, Suite 300, Anchorage, AK 99503; telephone: (907) 271-2511, fax: (907) 271-2725 before May 1, 2000.
