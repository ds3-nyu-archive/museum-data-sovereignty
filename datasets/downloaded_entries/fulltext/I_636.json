Individuals walking along the Flint River noticed human remains eroding out of the riverbank. They collected the human remains, along with objects, which the landowner later donated to the UMMAA, on June 29, 1979. The human remains are from one child, one adult male, two adult females, and three adults of indeterminate sex. At least three of the individuals were noted as having been interred in a flexed position. The human remains are dated to the Middle Late Woodland Period (A.D. 900-1200), based on diagnostic artifacts collected from the site. No known individuals were identified. The 2 associated funerary objects present are 1 ceramic elbow pipe with a collared rim and 1 awl made from a turkey bone.\\n        In June 1959, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the Ray Bradshaw Farm site (20TU1) in Tuscola County, MI. Workers excavating gravel inadvertently dug into a burial mound and unearthed commingled human remains and objects. The landowner collected the human remains and objects, and donated them to the UMMAA in July 1959. The human remains are from two adults. The human remains are dated to the Pre-Contact Period, based on diagnostic artifacts collected from the site. No known individuals were identified. The 10 associated funerary objects present are 6 antler tines and 4 pieces of chipped stone.\\n        In 1988, human remains representing, at minimum, six individuals were removed from the Hancock I site (20TU147) in Tuscola County, MI. The landowners were excavating sediment from what they thought was a natural knoll on their property. While depositing the sediment elsewhere on their property, the landowners noticed human remains and red ochre mixed in with the soil. They contacted archeologists at Saginaw Valley State University and Alma College for assistance. Although the human remains had been relocated away from the knoll where they were buried, the archeologists, their students, and members of the Michigan Archaeological Society carried out a survey and salvage excavation effort.\\n        The collections were donated to the UMMAA in 1990. The human remains are from one juvenile, one adolescent, three adults of indeterminate sex, and one cremated adult of indeterminate sex. The cremated human remains were found commingled with the non-cremated remains of an adult. Although the human remains were highly fragmentary, one individual was noted as possibly cremated in a flexed position. The human remains are dated to the Late Archaic to Early Woodland Periods (3500-500 B.C.), based on mortuary treatment. No known individuals were identified.
