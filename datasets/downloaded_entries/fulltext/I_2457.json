Accession records indicate that the human remains were donated to \\nthe University of Alaska Museum on May 1, 1949 by Mrs. Ellis and are \\nidentified as Accession 422, Catalog 16-1.\\n    The human remains represent an adult of unknown sex. There are no \\nmorphological features evident that would suggest that the human \\nremains are anything other than those of a Native Hawaiian. Based on \\nthe above information the University of Alaska Museum Curatorial Staff \\nbelieves that a relationship of shared group identity can be reasonably \\ntraced between the human remains and the descendants of the aboriginal \\npeople who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty in the \\narea that now constitutes the State of Hawai\\'i.\\n    The cranium was repatriated in May, 1991, to representatives of Hui \\nMalama I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei. The articulating mandible, which \\ncould not be located at that time, has since been found. \\nRepresentatives of culturally affiliated Native Hawaiian organizations \\nare advised that the mandible has been transferred to representatives \\nof Hui Malama I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei. Representatives of any other \\nNative Hawaiian organization that believes itself to be culturally \\naffiliated with this mandible should contact: Gary M. Selinger, \\nUniversity of Alaska Museum, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, \\nAK 99775, telephone: (907) 474-6117; and Kunani Nihipali, Hui Malama I \\nNa Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei, P.O. Box 190, Hale\\'iwa, HI 96712-0190 \\ntelephone: (808) 587-0010, by December 23, 1994. Reinternment of the \\nmandible by Hui Malama I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\n    Dated: November 15, 1994.\\nFrancis. P.
