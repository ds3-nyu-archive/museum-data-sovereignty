The human remains were removed from multiple counties in Arkansas.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1974, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were recovered from Sylamore Ferry site (3ST26) in Stone County, AR. A portion of the Sylamore Ferry site was going to be impacted by Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) construction. The excavations were undertaken by the AHTD, and the human remains were stored at Texas A&M University. In 1985, the human remains were returned to the AHTD and then eventually were taken for permanent storage to the Arkansas Archeological Survey (AAS). The gender and age of the human remains were undetermined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at the Sylamore Ferry site (3ST26) indicate that the human remains were probably buried during the Mississippian period (A.D. 1100 to 1600).\\n        In 1988, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were recovered from site 3LW15 in Lawrence County, AR, during preliminary analysis of the U.S. Highway 67 relocation in northeast Arkansas. No further work was done at this site because it was not within the project\\'s footprint. The human remains have remained in the AAS\\'s collections since the time of their removal. The gender and age of the human remains were undetermined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at site 3LW15 indicate that these human remains were probably buried during the Mississippian period (A.D. 900 to 1500).\\n        In 1995, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were recovered from site 3CG1059 in Craighead County, AR. The burials were discovered during Phase II excavation for the construction of Cash Bypass. The AHTD contracted the excavations out to the Center of Archaeological Research at Southwest Missouri State University. The human remains were transferred to the AAS for curation. The human remains were identified as two adults. The gender of the human remains was undetermined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at site 3CG1059 indicate that these human remains were probably buried possibly during the Mississippian period (A.D. 900 to 1500).\\n        In 1996, human remains representing, a minimum, six individuals were recovered from the Holden-Conner site (3JA632) in Jackson County, AR, during Phase III mitigation for the expansion and relocation of U.S. Highway 67. The AHTD contracted the excavations out to the Center of Archaeological Research at Southwest Missouri State University. The human remains were transferred to the AAS for curation. The human remains were identified as one infant (1-4 years), three children (4-8 years), and two young adults (16 to 21 years). The gender of the human remains was undetermined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at site 3JA632 indicate that these human remains were probably buried during the Late Mississippian period (A.D. 1400 to 1650).\\n        Determinations Made by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department\\n        Officials of the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 12 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, Cherokee Nation, The Osage Nation (previously listed as the Osage Tribe), The Quapaw Tribe of Indians, Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe, and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Kristina Boykin, Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department, P.O.
