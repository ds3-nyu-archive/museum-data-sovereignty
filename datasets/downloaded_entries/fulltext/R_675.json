The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of this cultural item. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        The one cultural item is an iron earring. \\n        Between 1880-1890, this cultural item was recovered from a grave about 8 miles from Throckmorton, Throckmorton County, TX, by relatives of Watson Grant Cutter. In 1967, Mr. Cutter gifted this cultural item to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. \\n        Museum records indicate that this cultural item was recovered from a Comanche grave located 8 miles from Throckmorton, Thockmorton County, TX. Based on the specific cultural affiliation described by the collector as well as the description of the burial context, this burial was most likely a Comanche burial from the historic period. Consultation with representatives of the Comanche Indian Tribe, Oklahoma identifies Throckmorton County, TX, as part of Comanche traditional territory during the historic period. \\n\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), this cultural item is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and is believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between this unassociated funerary object and the Comanche Indian Tribe, Oklahoma. This notice has been sent to officials of the Comanche Indian Tribe, Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this unassociated funerary object should contact Barbara Isaac, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, 11 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, telephone (617) 495-2254, before April 25, 2001. Repatriation of this unassociated funerary object to the Comanche Indian Tribe, Oklahoma may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: March 12, 2001. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 01-7383 Filed 3-23-01; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Intent To Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA ", "agency2": "National Park Service.
