The human remains were removed from San Miguel County, NM.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by University of Colorado Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        In 1939, human remains representing a minimum of three individuals were removed from near Pecos Pueblo, San Miguel County, NM, by an unknown individual. The human remains were donated to the University of Colorado Museum by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography (Peabody Museum), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, and cataloged into museum collections (Catalog numbers 6273-1, 6273-2, and 6274). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Based on proximity to Pecos Pueblo and analysis by the Peabody Museum, the human remains are Native American. Based on the ceramic types and architecture, Pecos Pueblo was occupied from approximately A.D. 1100-1700. Historic records document occupation at the site until approximately A.D. 1838 when the last inhabitants left the Pecos Pueblo and moved to the Pueblo of Jemez.\\n        In 1936, an Act of Congress recognized the Pueblo of Jemez as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsolidation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmerger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Pecos Pueblo and Pueblo of Jemez. All property, rights, titles, interests, and claims of both Pueblos were consolidated under the Pueblo of Jemez. Additional evidence supporting a shared group identity between the descendants of the Pecos and Jemez pueblos emerges in numerous aspects of present-day Jemez life and are documented in a 1992-1993 study, entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPecos Ethnographic Project.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Furthermore, during consultation, official representatives of the Pueblo of Jemez provided oral testimony supporting a shared group identity between the two pueblos. Based on archeological, historical documents, Federal legislation, consultation, and ethnographic evidence the descendants of the Pecos Pueblo are members of the Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico.\\n        Officials of the University of Colorado Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the University of Colorado Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Steve Lekson, Curator of Anthropology, University of Colorado Museum, Henderson Building, Campus Box 218, Boulder, CO 80309-0218, telephone (303) 492-6671, before October 11, 2006. Repatriation of the human remains to the Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        University of Colorado Museum is responsible for notifying the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo of Texas; and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: August 23, 2006\\n          C.
