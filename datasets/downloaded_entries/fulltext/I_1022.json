The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Logan Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota and the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        At an unknown date prior to 1979, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed by an unknown collector from the Old Kenel townsite on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in Corson County, SD. No details are available on the precise site location or collecting methods. The Old Kenel townsite was a historic community of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which was flooded after construction of Oahe Dam. This townsite was located on the site of a prehistoric Indian village that dates to the period of the Extended Middle Missouri variant of the Plains Village pattern. The human remains could be associated with either the historic or prehistoric settlement. The remains had been catalogued as Arikara, but there is no apparent basis for this designation. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The human remains are determined to be Native American on the basis of the red pigment applied to the remains. If the remains are from the Extended Middle Missouri variant, they are culturally affiliated to Mandan descendants, the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota. If the remains are Arikara, as the likely erroneous catalogue and ledger records state, they are culturally affiliated with the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota. If the remains are associated with the historic Lakota Sioux community of Old Kenel, they are culturally affiliated with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota, on whose reservation the site is located. Because the human remains could be associated with either the historic or prehistoric settlement, cultural affiliation is determined to be to both of the tribes.\\n        Determinations Made by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, DC, and the Logan Museum of Anthropology, Beloit College, Beloit, WI\\n        Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Logan Museum of Anthropology have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North & South Dakota and the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Anna Pardo, Museum Program Manager/NAGPRA Coordinator, U.S. Department of the Interior, Indian Affairs, 12220 Sunrise Valley Drive, Room 6084, Reston, VA 20191, telephone (703) 390-6343, before September 4, 2012.
