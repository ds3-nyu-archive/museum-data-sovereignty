Voth collected or \\nsecured these five masks through Charles Owen. These masks were then \\naccessioned into the collections of the Field Museum. In 1932 and 1933, \\nthese masks were purchased by the Laboratory of Anthropology, which \\nbecame part of the Museum of New Mexico in 1947.\\n    Accession records of the Field Museum and the Museum of New Mexico \\nclearly indicate these Spirit Friends are of Hopi origin from Hopi \\nvillages in Northern Arizona. Consultation evidence presented by \\nrepresentatives of the Hopi tribe and Hopi traditional religious \\nleaders identified these Katsina Friends as objects needed by \\ntraditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. \\nConsultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe further indicate \\nthat the Katsinmomngwit (Hopi traditional religious leaders) are the \\nonly rightful custodians of the Katsina Friends.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Museum \\nof New Mexico have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C), \\nthese five cultural items are specific ceremonial objects needed by \\ntraditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. \\nLastly, officials of the Museum of New Mexico have determined that, \\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the \\nHopi Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hopi Tribe. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these objects should contact Dr. Bruce \\nBernstein, Director, Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Museum of New \\nMexico, P.O. Box 2087, Santa Fe, NM 87504-2087; telephone (505) 827-\\n6344 before May 16, 1997. Repatriation of these objects to the Hopi \\nTribe may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\nDated: April 9, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
