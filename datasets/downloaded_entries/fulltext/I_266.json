The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from a highway construction project on US-12, Lenawee County, MI.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made during 1993-1995 by the former Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) professional staff and by a physical anthropologist. According to documents held by the SHPO, in 1995 the OSA initiated consultation on the human remains and funerary objects with the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Oklahoma; Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Hannahville Indian Community, Michigan; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Michigan and Indiana; and Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation (previously listed as the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, Kansas).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In the 1920s, human remains representing nine individuals were removed from a highway construction project in Lenawee County, MI. In 1925, the remains were re-interred on the grounds of the Walker Tavern historic site, located a few miles from the highway construction project. The Walker Tavern structure was built around 1832, as a farmhouse, and then became a tavern and inn along the Detroit to Chicago stagecoach route. In 1921, Frederic Hewitt converted the tavern into a museum, and in 1965, the structure was sold to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The Parks and Recreation Division of the Michigan Department of Conservation operated the historic site until 1975, when the Michigan Historical Museum, which was part of the Michigan Historical Center (MHC), took responsibility for the Walker Tavern museum and its collections.\\n\\n        In the mid-1990s, Barbara Mead, Assistant State Archaeologist, did the NAGPRA reporting for the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) and for the state museum. At that time, the state museum turned over to Ms. Mead a single cranium and associated funerary objects that she determined had been part of the group of human remains that was re-interred on the grounds of the Walker Tavern site in 1925.\\n        In 2009, the Department of History, Arts, and Libraries, which included both the OSA and the state museum, was eliminated. The state museum was moved into the Department of Natural Resources, and the OSA was moved into the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. Soon after that, the OSA was eliminated, and the archaeology staff were moved into the SHPO. Consequently, the archaeological collections, including the Walker Tavern materials, are now held by the SHPO.\\n        The human remains in the Walker Tavern collection include a single cranium with no teeth present and lacking the mandible. The cranium was examined by a physical anthropologist who stated that the individual was approximately 10-15 years of age, and that no determination of sex or ethnic identity of the individual could be made. No known individuals were identified.\\n        When the state museum assumed responsibility for the Walker Tavern collection in 1975, the cranium was recorded under Michigan Department of Conservation accession number A1253. The state museum assigned catalog number FA-155-75 to the cranium.\\n        The state museum also cataloged a group of 18 funerary objects associated with the human remains disinterred during road construction in the 1920s. The 18 associated funerary objects are: One pewter spoon, one bottle, one oval stone, one deer mandible, three loose teeth, one lot of fur pieces with tassels wrapped in porcupine quill, one silver armband, one wooden bowl or toy canoe, one lot of wool scraps, one lot of linen scraps, one silver armband, one copper or brass kettle fragment, one iron knife blade, one lot of very small bone chips, one lot of shell and glass beads and one pewter bowl.\\n        Based on the funerary objects, it is estimated that the original interment of the objects and the human remains took place between approximately 1760 and 1810. A typescript in the MHC Walker Tavern files identified as an article in the Lenawee County Exponent dated November 22, 1923, describes the discovery of Indian graves and artifacts during road construction work in the Irish Hills area. The article mentions some of the same funerary objects described above and associated with the cranium. This assemblage of funerary objects, including trade silver and beads, together with the cranium, represent a Native American interment.\\n\\n        The inventory that Assistant State Archaeologist Barbara Mead compiled in 1995 included the following information on cultural affiliation: Probably Potawatomi. Early in the eighteenth century, the Potawatomi, Miami, Ottawa, Huron/Wyandotte and Kickapoo were present in southern Michigan. Most of the reports for tribes other than the Potawatomi are from the pre-1720 era. By the 1760s, the Potawatomi territory included Lenawee County; no other tribes seemed to be present, except perhaps as travelers or temporary residents.
