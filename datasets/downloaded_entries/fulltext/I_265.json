Subsequently, the human remains were transferred to the control of the New York State Museum. This site was also excavated by amateurs as well as the New York State Museum. Much has been published on the site, including data showing it was a multicomponent site dating between circa A.D. 1000 and 1600. No known individuals are associated with that burial. The human remains and some associated funerary objects (AFOs) have been under the control of the New York State Museum since their excavation; the remainder of the AFOs are under the control of the University. The 197 AFOs under the control of Binghamton University are: Six chert decortification flakes, one chert shatter, three chert blocks, 14 chert waste flakes, one large chert waste flake, three chert blocks, eight chert shatter, six chert decortification flakes, 52 chert waste flakes, seven utilized chert flakes, 18 chert waste flakes, one chert decortification flake, two chert shatter, one possible utilized flake, eight chert shatter, five chert decortification flakes, one fire-reddened jasper waste flake, six chert chunks, four utilized chert flakes, one retouched chert flake, and 49 chert waste flakes.
