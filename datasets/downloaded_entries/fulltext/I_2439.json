No known individuals were identified. No associated \\nfunerary object are present. Site UKT-023 has been identified as a 19th \\ncentury Eskimo habitation site based on architecture and written \\naccounts of the area from the 1860s. Oral history presented by \\nrepresentative of the Native Village of Unalakleet, in addition to the \\ntraditional Eskimo name for this site area, indicates this site is \\nassociated with the Village of Unalakleet.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, Bureau of Land Management \\nofficials have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the \\nhuman remains listed above represent the physical remains of one \\nindividual of Native American ancestry. Bureau of Land Management \\nofficials have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), \\nthere is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects and the Native Village of Unalakleet.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Native Village of \\nUnalakleet. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes \\nitself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects should contact Dr. Robert E.
