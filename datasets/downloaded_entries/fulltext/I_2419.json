No known individuals were \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    In 1989, human remains representing three individuals were \\nrecovered from the Leta Young site (53.23) in Benton, ME, during \\nlegally authorized archeological testing. In 1995, these human remains \\nwere transferred to the Maine State Museum by the University of Maine \\nat Farmington. No known individuals were identified. The associated \\nfunerary object is a strand of shell beads.\\n    The two sites listed above are located in Kennebec County, ME \\nwithin the historically documented territory of the Etchemin, from whom \\nthe present-day Penobscot Indian Nation trace their descent. The \\nindividuals from these two sites date from the late precontact into the \\nhistoric period (1335-1765 AD) based on radiocarbon dates of 405 +/- \\n105 and 432 +/- 60 B.P. respectively. Osteological evidence indicates \\nthese individuals are morphologically consistent with contemporary \\nNative Americans.\\n    In the early 1960s, human remains representing two individuals were \\nrecovered from the Fort Pemaquid site (16.49) in Bristol, ME, by the \\nMaine Bureau of Parks and Recreation and were transferred to the Maine \\nState Museum in 1982. No known individuals were identified. The \\nfourteen associated funerary objects include sheet brass tubes, brass \\nsheets, a copper or brass disk, leather, hide, and bark fragments.\\n    In 1995, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom the Fort Pemaquid site (16.49) by the Maine Historic Preservation \\nCommission and transferred to the Maine State Museum. No known \\nindividual was identified. No associated funerary objects were present.\\n    Osteological evidence indicates these individuals are \\nmorphologically consistent with contemporary Native Americans. The Fort \\nPemaquid site is located in Lincoln County, ME within the historically \\ndocumented territory of the Etchemin, from whom the present-day \\nPenobscot Indian Nation trace their descent. Based on the associated \\nfunerary objects and a radiocarbon date of 660 +/- 50 B.P., these human \\nremains are estimated to be from the late to terminal precontact period \\ninto the early historic period (ca. 1190-16th century AD.).\\n    During 1967-1969, human remains representing 23 individuals were \\nrecovered from the Goddard site (30.42) by Mr. Guy Mellgren and Mr. \\nEdward Runge who donated them to the Maine State Museum in 1972 and \\n1973. No known individuals were identified. The eighteen associated \\nfunerary objects include celts, ochre, copper beads, fragments of \\ncopper, leather, fur, plant material, and a shark tooth.\\n    In 1980, human remains representing five individuals were recovered \\nfrom the Goddard site (30.42) during Maine State Museum excavations. No \\nknown individuals were identified. The seven associated funerary \\nobjects include copper beads, fragments of copper, plant material, fur, \\nand leather.\\n    Osteological evidence indicates these individuals are \\nmorphologically consistent with contemporary Native Americans. The \\nGoddard site is located in Hancock County, ME within the historically \\ndocumented territory of the Etchemin, from whom the present-day \\nPenobscot Indian Nation trace their descent. Based on cultural \\nmaterial, specifically the presence of European trade copper, and \\nradiocarbon dates of 377+/- 57, 540 +/- 50, and 679 +/- 59 B.P., these \\nhuman remains are estimated to be from the late precontact period to \\nthe terminal precontact period--early historic period (1153- 1707 AD.). \\nBecause there is so little European trade material, an earlier rather \\nthan later date is more likely for these human remains.\\n    In 1976, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom the Parson\\'s site (29.47) by the Maine State Museum. No known \\nindividuals were identified. No associated funerary objects were \\npresent.\\n    Osteological evidence indicates this individual is morphologically \\nconsistent with contemporary Native Americans. The Parson\\'s site is \\nlocated in Knox County, ME within the historically documented territory \\nof the Etchemin, from whom the present-day Penobscot Indian Nation \\ntrace their descent. Although the radiocarbon dates are 400 +/- 110 \\nB.P. (1330--1770 AD.), these human remains are estimated to be from the \\nlate precontact period based on the precontact cultural material and \\nabsence of any cultural material of European or Euroamerican origin at \\nParson\\'s site.\\n    In 1984 and 1985, human remains representing one individual were \\nrecovered from the Oak Island site (70.3) in Skowhegan, ME by the Maine \\nState Medical Examiner\\'s office and the University of Maine at \\nFarmington (UMF). In 1994, these human remains were transferred to the \\nMaine State Museum by UMF. No known individuals were identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects were present.\\n    Osteological evidence indicates this individual is morphologically \\nconsistent with contemporary Native Americans. This site is located in \\nSomerset County, ME, within the historically documented territory of \\nthe Etchemin, from whom the present-day Penobscot Indian Nation trace \\ntheir decsent. Based on radiocarbon dates of 270+/- 60 B.P. from this \\nsite, this burial dates from the late precontact to the historic period \\n(1560-1800 AD).\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Maine \\nState Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the \\nhuman remains listed above represent the physical remains of 43 \\nindividuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Maine State \\nMuseum have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), \\nthe 40 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed \\nwith or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as \\npart of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Maine \\nState Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), \\nthere is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and \\nassociated funerary objects and the Penobscot Indian Nation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Aroostook Band of \\nMicMacs, Houlton Band of Maliseets, Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the \\nPenobscot Indian Nation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Dr. Bruce Bourque, Chief \\nArchaeologist, Maine State Museum, 83 State House Station, Augusta, ME \\n04333; telephone (207) 287-2301, before July 21, 1997. Repatriation of \\nthe human remains and associated funerary objects to the Penobscot \\nIndian Nation may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\nDated: June 13, 1997.\\nDaniel Haas,\\nActing Departmental Consulting Archeologist,\\nArcheology and Ethnography Program.\\n[FR Doc. 97-16165 Filed 6-19-97; 8:45 am]\\nBILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n\\n\\n\\n", "agency1": "Null", "sub_agency1": "Null", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Null", "agency2": "Null", "action": "Null", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Null", "signature_name": "Null", "signature_title": "Null", "fr_doc": "Null", "billing_code": "Null", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
