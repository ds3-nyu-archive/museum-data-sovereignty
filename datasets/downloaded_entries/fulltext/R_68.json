Parker obtained four wooden medicine masks for the Museum from Delos Kettle of Lawton, NY. Parker attributed three of the medicine masks to the I\\'dos Society (E-36864, E-36865, E-36866). A fourth medicine mask was unattributed (E-37022).\\n        In June of 1909, Arthur C. Parker commissioned one partially carved medicine mask for the Museum to be made on the Cattaraugus Reservation (E-36917).
