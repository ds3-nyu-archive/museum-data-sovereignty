The human remains were in the possession of Anthony Zallio, a private collector, who posthumously donated his collection in 1951 to the Department of Anthropology at Sacramento State College, CA (now California State University, Sacramento). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Archeological data from the site indicates occupation occurred during the Middle and Late Horizons. Additional archeological data suggests occupation may have lasted into an unknown time during the Historic period.\\n        Sometime during the 1920s and 1930s, human remains representing, at minimum, six individuals, were removed from CA-YOL-013 (also known as the Mustang site), located on the south bank of the Sacramento River at the confluence of the Sacramento River, Feather River, and Sacramento Slough in west-central Yolo County, CA. The human remains were in the possession of Anthony Zallio, a private collector, who posthumously donated his collection in 1951 to the Department of Anthropology at Sacramento State College, CA (now California State University, Sacramento). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Archeological data indicates occupation of the site occurring as early as Phase 1 of the Late Horizon, lasting until an unknown time during the historic period. Ethnographic evidence suggest that CA-YOL-013 may be the site of a large historic Nisenan Village known as Hol\\'-lo-wi or a close association thereof.\\n\\n        Archeological evidence indicates that the lower Sacramento Valley and Delta regions were continuously occupied since at least the Early Horizon (5550-550 B.C.). Cultural changes indicated by artifact typologies and burial patterns, historical linguistic evidence, and biological evidence reveal that the populations in the region were not static, with both in situ cultural changes and migrations of outside populations into the area. Linguistic evidence suggests that ancestral-Penutian speaking groups related to modern day Miwok, Nisenan, and Patwin groups occupied the region during the Middle (550 B.C.-A.D. 1100) and Late (A.D. 1100-Historic) Horizons, with some admixing between these groups and Hokan-speaking groups that occupied the region at an earlier date. The genetic data suggests that the Penutians may have arrived later than suggested by the linguistics.\\n\\n        Geographical data from ethnohistoric and ethnographic sources indicate that the site was most likely occupied by Nisenan-speaking groups at the beginning of the historic period, while Patwin-speakers occupied the valley west of the Sacramento River and Miwok-speakers resided south of the American River. Ethnographic data and expert testimony from Tribes support the high level of interaction between groups in the lower Sacramento Valley and Delta regions that crosscut linguistic boundaries. Historic population movements resulted in an increased level of shifting among populations, especially among populations who were impacted by disease, violence, and Euro-American activities relating to Sutter\\'s Fort and later gold-rush activities.\\n        In summary, the ethnographic, historical, and geographical evidence available indicate that the burials listed above are most closely affiliated with contemporary descendants of the Nisenan with more distant ties to neighboring groups, such as Miwok, Patwin, and Yokut. The earlier remains from the Middle and Late Horizons share cultural relations with the Plains Miwok, Nisenan, and Yokut based on archeological, biological, and historical linguistic evidence.\\n        Determinations Made by California State University, Sacramento\\n        Officials of California State University, Sacramento have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 7 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract), California and United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria of California.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Orn Bodvarsson, Dean of the College of Social Sciences and Interdisciplinary Studies, CSUS, 6000 J Street, Sacramento, CA 95819-6109, telephone (916) 278-4864, email obbodvarsson@csus.edu, by March 6, 2015.
