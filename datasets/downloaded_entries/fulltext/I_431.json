The human remains were part of the Amy Harvey collection. Amy Harvey collected Oneota materials while doing doctoral research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the early 1960s, and retained the materials when she began teaching at Stephens College in Columbia, MO, in 1965. The human remains were transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist Bioarchaeology Program in 2010 and 2013 (Burial Project 3102). The human remains represent one adult of indeterminate age and sex; and five subadults of indeterminate sex, as follows: One child two years old, one child 2.5 to 3.5 years old, one child 3.5 to 4.5 years old, one child 5.0 to 6.5 years old, and one child 7 to 15 years old. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Blood Run site (13LO2) is a large Oneota tradition village located in Iowa and South Dakota, straddling the Big Sioux River southeast of Sioux Falls, SD. Archeological evidence, including radiocarbon dates and trade artifacts, suggests that the site was occupied from A.D. 1500 to 1700. Tribal histories, supported by French historical maps and documents, suggest that the Omaha, Ponca, Iowa, and Oto tribes were present in the area at that time and were the probable residents of the site. The Ho-Chunk and Winnebago are also ethno-historically linked to these tribes.
