The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Museum of Anthropology, Washington State University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington.\\n        In 1969 and 1970, human remains representing a minimum of nine individuals were removed from the Minard site (45-GH-15) in Grays Harbor County, WA, by Richard Daugherty, an employee, and Thomas E. Roll, graduate student, of Washington State University. The excavations were conducted under research funds allocated by the Washington State Legislature. No known individuals were identified. The 82 associated funerary objects are 2 nipple topped mauls, 1 ground slate knife, 1 ground stone club, 1 necklace of rolled copper and dentalium beads, 1 straight adze with a carved whale bone handle, 1 knife or small adze-chisel, 1 metal chisel, 1 metal awl, 1 lot of metal fragments from wood working tools, 5 lots of nails, 2 lots of glass beads, 2 lots of tin can fragments, 5 lots of unidentified metal fragments, 2 spoons, 3 lots of wood fragments, 14 thimbles on a string, 1 lot of unidentified plant material, and 38 lots of dishes and dish fragments.\\n        \\n        Osteological evidence indicates that the human remains from the Minard site represent nine individuals of Native American ancestry. The associated funerary objects found with one of the individuals indicate an interment during the early 19th century. Stratigraphic information indicates that the other individuals were interred within the last 1,000 years. The Minard site is located at or near the traditional Copalis village of Oyhut. The Copalis are considered to have been a band of the Lower Chehalis whose traditional territory encompassed the lower reaches of the Chehalis River and the present-day county of Grays Harbor. The Minard site is located within the area identified by the Indian Claims Commission as the aboriginal territory of the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington.
