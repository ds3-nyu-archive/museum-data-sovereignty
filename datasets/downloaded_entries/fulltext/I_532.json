As an adult, in August 2015, he relinquished them to the Montezuma County Coroner, who ruled out a forensic interest. The human remains were transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSAC) in October 2015, where they were assigned Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 311.

No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, five individuals were removed from an unknown place, possibly in the vicinity of Mancos, CO. The human remains were discovered in the estate of a deceased man. In November 2015, the son of the man turned them over to the Montezuma County Coroner, who ruled out forensic interest. In February 2016, the human remains were transferred to the Office of the State Archaeologist, where they were assigned Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 313. Osteological analysis at Metropolitan State University indicates that the human remains represent two adult females, two children and one male and are likely of Native American ancestry.

No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        History Colorado, in partnership with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, conducted tribal consultations among the tribes with ancestral ties to the State of Colorado to develop the process for disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from inadvertent discoveries on Colorado State and private lands. As a result of the consultation, a process was developed, the Process for Consultation, Transfer, and Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating From Inadvertent Discoveries on Colorado State and Private Lands (2008, unpublished, on file with the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation). The tribes consulted are those who have expressed their wishes to be notified of discoveries in the Southwest Region as established by the Process, where these individuals appear to have originated.\\n\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. On November 3-4, 2006, the Process was presented to the Review Committee for consideration. A January 8, 2007, letter on behalf of the Review Committee from the Designated Federal Officer transmitted the provisional authorization to proceed with the Process upon receipt of formal responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, subject to forthcoming conditions imposed by the Secretary of the Interior. On May 15-16, 2008, the responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma were submitted to the Review Committee. On September 23, 2008, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, as the designee for the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains according to the Process and NAGPRA, pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.
