No known \\nindividuals were identified. No associated funerary objects were \\npresent.\\n    Based on cranial morphology and dentition, this individual has been \\nidentified as Native American. Crainometric measurements of these human \\nremains indicate they are consistent with present-day Blackfeet people. \\nConsultation evidence including oral tradition provided by Blackfeet \\nNation representatives indicate that south-central South Dakota was \\npart of their original territory, and they often conducted exchanges \\nand trade in the area. Historical documents also mention Blackfeet \\ntravelling parties near the Black Hills with Gros Ventre (Atsina); and \\nassociations with Arapaho and Cheyenne in places as distant as the \\nSouth Plains.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the South \\nDakota State Archaeological Research Center have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above \\nrepresent the physical remains of one individual of Native American \\nancestry. Officials of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research \\nCenter have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is \\na relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and the Blackfeet Nation of \\nMontana.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Blackfeet Nation of \\nMontana. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects should contact Renee Boen, Curator, South Dakota State \\nArchaeological Research Center, P.O. Box 1257, Rapid City, SD 57709-\\n1257; telephone: (605) 394-1936, before May 27, 1998. Repatriation of \\nthe human remains to the Blackfeet Nation of Montana may begin after \\nthat date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: April 21, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
