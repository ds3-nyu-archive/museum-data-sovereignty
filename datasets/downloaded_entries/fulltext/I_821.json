Stoltman and Bennett excavated a conical mound located near Shawano Lake after the landowner discovered burials during construction on his property. The mound was originally one of three conicals, but when Stoltman and Bennett arrived, much of the mound had already been removed. The human remains are fragmentary and represent an adult and a child from Burial 1; a child and an adolescent from Burials 2 and 3; an adult, probably male, from Feature 3; an old age adult from Features 7 and 8; and an old age adult and a child from Feature 9. No known individuals were identified. The 14 associated funerary objects are: 1 Copper awl; 1 small prehistoric ceramic vessel with incised lines; 1 portion of a Madison Plain prehistoric ceramic vessel; 2 ceramic sherds representing a third, distinct vessel; 1 lot of quartz flakes; 1 sample of soil matrix; 1 large section of a Point Sauble Collared vessel; 1 lot of charcoal; 1 lot of charcoal, seeds, and soil matrix; 1 copper fragment; 1 lot of prehistoric ceramic sherds from a cord-roughened pot; 1 lot of acorns and charcoal; and 1 painted prehistoric ceramic vessel section.
