Coleman of Spearfish, SD. In 1995, \\nthese human remains were discovered in the collections of the Adams \\nMemorial Museum, Deadwood, SD and were transferred that same year to \\nthe South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center. No known \\nindividual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    Based on cranial morphology and dentition, this individual has been \\nidentified as Native American. Extensive copper staining on the cranium \\nindicates a post-1700 AD date for this burial. Based on crainometric \\nmeasurements, oral tradition, and historical evidence, the cultural \\naffiliation of this individual from eastern Montana is most likely with \\nthe Brule division of the Lakota tribe. The Brule currently reside and \\nare represented by the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian \\nReservation and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of the Lower Brule \\nReservation.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the South \\nDakota State Archaeological Research Center have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above \\nrepresent the physical remains of one individual of Native American \\nancestry. Officials of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research \\nCenter have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is \\na relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe \\nof the Rosebud Indian Reservation and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of \\nthe Lower Brule Reservation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe \\nof the Rosebud Indian Reservation and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe of \\nthe Lower Brule Reservation. Representatives of any other Indian tribe \\nthat believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects should contact Renee Boen,\\n\\n[[Page 43714]]\\n\\nCurator, State Archaeological Center, South Dakota Historical Society, \\nP.O.
