The human remains were transferred to the University of Washington, Burke Museum in 1945, and then to the Alaska Region USFWS headquarters in 2016. The human remains include 21 vertebrae, three ribs, sternum, sacrum, one patella, and hand and foot bones, and represent one adult male. No known individual was identified. The one associated funerary object is an unmodified mammal bone.\\n        There are no diagnostics artifacts or radiocarbon dates associated with the human remains. The consensus among anthropologists is that midden sites began to appear around 3,000 years ago. The human remains were found on the surface of the midden and likely date to the Late Prehistoric period, possibly no earlier than 500\\xe2\\x80\\x941000 years B.P.\\n        On April 15th, 1944, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Adak Island, Aleutians West Census Area, AK, by Harley Goodrich while operating a bulldozer. The human remains include one cranium, discovered at a depth of approximately 25 feet. The human remains were transferred to the University of Washington, Burke Museum on August 1, 1944. A physical anthropologist at the Burke Museum determined that the human remains are from an adult female. No known individuals were identified.
