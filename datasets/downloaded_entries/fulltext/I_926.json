The associated funerary objects were removed from a small island off Prince of Wales Island, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the associated funerary objects was made by the Rochester Museum & Science Center professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes and the Hydaburg Cooperative Association.\\n        History and Description of the Objects\\n        Sometime prior to 1924, five associated funerary objects were removed from an unnamed small island off Prince of Wales Island, AK, according to Rochester Museum & Science Center catalogue records. The associated funerary objects that at one time housed human remains were collected by Esther Gibson, who worked as a missionary nurse in Alaska for 33 years. On May 29, 1924, the Rochester Museum & Science Center (then Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences) purchased the associated funerary objects from Gibson, who lived in Rochester, NY, at the time. No known individuals were identified. The five associated funerary objects are 1 wooden cremation box (24.57.3/AE 471), 1 sea lion hide (24.57.4/AE 472), 1 plaited cremation basket (24.57.5/AE 473), 1 rope (24.57.6/AE 474), and 1 plaited mat (24.57.7/AE 475).\\n        The Rochester Museum & Science Center\\'s collections records indicate that the associated funerary objects were found under a cliff on a small island off Prince of Wales Island, AK. The records state that the cremation box contained the ashes of a Tlingit shaman or chief wrapped in the sea lion hide, but the human remains are not present. The mat was wrapped around the outside of the box to protect it and secured with the rope. The documentation also states that the cremation basket, found beside the cremation box, contained the ashes of a slave, that are not present. A medallion adorning the top of the cremation box appears to commemorate George III of England, circa A.D. 1760-1800. Through consultation, it has been established that it was not uncommon for the Tlingit to acquire foreign objects through trade and use them to decorate cultural objects. Tlingit consultants also identified the paintings on the box as an old style Tlingit design probably dating to the late 1700s. This documentary, physical, and cultural evidence strongly suggests that the associated funerary objects are culturally affiliated with the Tlingit. This affiliation is also supported by historical evidence, which shows that the Prince of Wales Island was traditionally a Tlingit territory. It was not until the late 18th century that the Tlingit began to leave the area and the Kaigani Haida inhabited their abandoned villages.\\n        Determinations Made by the Rochester Museum & Science Center\\n        Officials of the Rochester Museum & Science Center have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the five objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American associated funerary objects and the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to George McIntosh, Rochester Museum & Science Center, 657 East Ave., Rochester, NY 14607, telephone (585) 271-4552 x 306, email george_mcintosh@rmsc.org, by September 16, 2013.
