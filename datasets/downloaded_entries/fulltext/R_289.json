The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        The 36 unassociated funerary objects are ceramic vessels, at least two of which contain corn. The vessels are bowls, mugs, pitchers, vases (seed jars), jars and ladles. The vessel styles are black-on-gray, black-on-white, Tusayan black-on-red, corrugated and gray ware. Between 1897 and 1898, human remains, associated and unassociated funerary objects, as well as other cultural items were removed from a cliff ruin in a canyon tributary of Comb Wash, San Juan County, UT, under the auspices of the Lang Expedition of 1897-1898. Prior to 1900, General William Jackson Palmer acquired what became known as the Lang-Bixby Collection, which he subsequently transferred to The Colorado College. Beginning in the late 1960s, the Lang-Bixby Collection was transferred, along with other collections from The Colorado College Museum, through long-term loans to the Fine Arts Center (formerly known as the Taylor Museum and the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center) and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (formerly known as the Denver Museum of Natural History). In 1993, the Fine Arts Center included the unassociated funerary objects from the Lang-Bixby Collection in its NAGPRA summary.\\n\\n        The unassociated funerary objects are ancestral Puebloan based on type and style. The human remains and associated funerary objects from this collection were described in two Notices of Inventory Completion (NICs) published in the Federal Register (74 FR 42105-42106, August 20, 2009, and 69 FR 19232-19233, April 12, 2004). The human remains and associated funerary objects were determined to be Ancestral Puebloan. A relationship of shared group identity can reasonably be traced between ancestral Puebloan peoples and modern Puebloan peoples based on oral tradition and scientific studies. The human remains and associated funerary objects have been repatriated to the Hopi Tribe of Arizona.
