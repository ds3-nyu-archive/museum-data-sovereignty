Human remains were recovered and transferred to the Duwamish Tribe, a non-Federally recognized Indian group, in 1991. The funerary objects were retained by BOAS, Inc., and were received by the Burke Museum in 2003 (Accn. #2003-98). The 23 unassociated funerary objects are three lots of metal fragments, five lots of beads, three lots of ceramic fragments, three stone tools, one nail, one shell fragment, two non-human bone fragments, one lot of cedar wood, one piece of charcoal, one lot of buttons, one penny, and one flake.\\n        Sba\\'badid was the site of a historic Duwamish village until the mid-19th century (Chatters 1981). The terms of the 1855 Point Elliott Treaty assigned the Duwamish to the Suquamish Reservation (called Fort Kitsap at the time). After 1856, due to violence between whites and Native Americans, as well as the competition over available resources, many Duwamish left the Suquamish Reservation. The Indian agent subsequently assigned the Duwamish to the Muckleshoot reservation. Descendants of the Duwamish people are members of the present-day Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and the Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation.\\n        Determinations Made by the Burke Museum\\n        Officials of the Burke Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 23 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington) and the Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Peter Lape, Burke Museum, University of Washington, Box 353010, Seattle, WA 98195, telephone (206) 685-3849, email plape@uw.edu, by April 1, 2019.
