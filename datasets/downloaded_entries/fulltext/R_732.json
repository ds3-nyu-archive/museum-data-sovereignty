Representatives of wa ma nu ka cha bra (Eagle \\nClan) have stated that these items are needed by traditional religious \\nleaders for the practice of Native American religion by their present-\\nday adherents. Representatives of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and \\nthe Eagle Clan of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin have indicated that \\nthe Stealer Bundle and all associated items are owned communally by the \\nclan as a whole and no individual had\\n\\n[[Page 49506]]\\n\\nthe right to sell or otherwise alienate the Stealer Bundle or and \\nassociated items.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the State \\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin have determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (d)(3), these 28 cultural items are specific ceremonial \\nobjects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the \\npractice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day \\nadherents. Officials of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin have \\nalso determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(4), these 28 cultural \\nitems have ongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance \\ncentral to the culture itself, and could not have been alienated, \\nappropriated, or conveyed by any individual. Officials of the State \\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin have also determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these items and the Ho-Chunk Nation of \\nWisconsin.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Ho-Chunk Nation of \\nWisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Representatives of any \\nother Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated \\nwith these objects should contact Ms. Jennifer Kolb, Director, Museum \\nArcheology Program, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 816 State \\nStreet, Madison, WI 53706; telephone (608) 264-6560; e-mail: \\n[emailÂ protected] before October 13, 1999.
