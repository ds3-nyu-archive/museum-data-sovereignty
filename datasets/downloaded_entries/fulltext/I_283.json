The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the University of Arkansas Museum Collections professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Between 1976 and 1978, human remains representing, at minimum, 47 individuals were removed from Roden Site (34MC215) in McCurtain, OK, by the Museum of the Red River, Gregory Perino, and Lester Roden. At a date prior to 1981, the human remains were sent to the University of Arkansas for bioarcheological analysis and subsequently, they were donated to University of Arkansas Museum Collections by Jerome Rose. The human remains consist of 13 adult males, 12 adult females, nine children, four infants, and nine adults of unknown sex (2004-4-(1-44), 2004-4-10-1, 2 & 3, 2004-4-22-1, 2). No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Roden site is located on an alluvial terrace of the Red River in southeastern Oklahoma. According to Perino, excavations and radiocarbon dates strongly correlate with a Caddo presence stretching from A.D. 1300 to 1650, which is described as the McCurtain Phase. This date can be split into two periods of intense use; the first being approximately A.D. 1300 and the second occurring between A.D.1510-1620. The human remains are associated with the second phase. Descendants of the Caddo are members of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, seven individuals were removed from the Bowman/Wallace site (3LR50), Little River County, AR, by unknown persons. The human remains were donated to the University of Arkansas Anthropology Department at an unknown date. In 2006, they were transferred to the University of Arkansas Museum Collections. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Georgia Lake site (3OU112), Ouachita County, AR, by unknown persons. The human remains were donated to the University of Arkansas Anthropology Department at an unknown date. In 2006, they were transferred to the University of Arkansas Museum Collections. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        Based on the geographic region, diagnostic artifacts reported at the sites, site organization, and methods of interment, the human remains removed from burials at the two sites described above date to the Fourche Maline period (A.D. 500-800) and/or Caddoan period (A.D. 800-1600). Archeological evidence suggests a cultural continuity through these periods. Archeological and historical evidence indicate that Caddoan peoples occupied the Ouachita Mountains and southwestern Arkansas during both time periods.
