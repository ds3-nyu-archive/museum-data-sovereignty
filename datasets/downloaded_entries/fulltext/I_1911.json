The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Native Village of Kotzebue.\\n        In 1895, human remains representing one individual were removed from an unknown location on Choris Peninsula in Kotzebue Sound, AK, by Mr. Benjamin Sharp.  Mr. Sharp collected these human remains for the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, and in 1997, the human remains were transferred from the Academy of Natural Sciences to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.  No known individual was identified.  No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Museum documentation and published sources describe the human remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEskimo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and date them to the 19th century.  Published sources and consultation information indicate that the Native Village of Kotzebue, which is represented by Kotzebue IRA government, occupied the area where the human remains were recovered during the 19th century.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.  Officials of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology also have determined that pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Native Village of Kotzebue.\\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Native Village of Kotzebue, the Kikiktagruk Inupiat Corporation, and the NANA Regional Corporation.  Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Dr. Jeremy Sabloff, the Williams Director, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 33rd and Spruce Streets, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6324, telephone (215) 898-4051, fax (215) 898-0657, before October 28, 2002.  Repatriation of the human remains to the Native Village of Kotzebue may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        \\n          Dated: August 8, 2002.\\n          Robert Stearns,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 02-24625 Filed 9-26-02; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-S\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia, PA", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.", "action": "Notice.", "summary": "Null", "dates": "Null", "addresses": "Null", "signature_dated": "Dated: August 8, 2002.", "signature_name": "Robert Stearns,", "signature_title": "Manager, National NAGPRA Program.", "fr_doc": "[FR Doc. 02-24625 Filed 9-26-02; 8:45 am]", "billing_code": "BILLING CODE 4310-70-S", "supp_info": "Null", "consultation": "Null", "h_d_r": "Null", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Null", "a_r_d": "Null"}
