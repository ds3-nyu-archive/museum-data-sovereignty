The headdress was purchased by the Museum in 1983 from \\nBoyd Didrickson and is designated accession number 83.134 in the Museum \\nrecords.\\n    Evidence provided by the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit confirms \\nthat the headdress is of ongoing historical, traditional, and cultural \\nimportance to the clan, and that at the time the headdress was \\nseparated from the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, no individual \\nclan member was considered to have the right to convey it to a non-clan \\nmember without clan consent.\\n    The Douglas Indian Association, an association recognized as \\neligible for the special programs and services provided by the United \\nStates to Indians because of their status as Indians, has petitioned \\nfor the repatriation of the headdress on behalf of the Yanyeidi Clan of \\nthe Taku Tlingit. Representatives of the Douglas Indian Association, \\nthe Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, and the Museum have determined \\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2) that there is a relationship of shared \\ngroup identity which can be reasonably traced between the headdress, \\nthe Douglas Indian Association, and the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku \\nTlingit. The Museum has agreed to repatriate the headdress.\\n    Representatives of any other Indian tribe or Alaska Native village \\nor corporation that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with \\nthis item should contact Patricia B. Wolf, Museum Director, Anchorage \\nMuseum of History and Art, 121 W. 7th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99501, \\n(907) 343-4326, before [thirty days following publication of this \\nnotice]. Repatriation of the item to the Douglas Indian Association, on \\nbehalf of the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, may begin after that \\ndate if no additional claimants come forward.\\n    Dated: June 30, 1994\\nC.
