Collectively, these items \\nare referred to as Na\\'at\\'oye\\' jish, or Shooting/Lightening Way \\nparaphernalia\\n    On July 19, 1996, an undercover Special Agent of the U.S. Fish  \\nWildlife Service purchased two prayer sticks, an animal skip wrap, and \\ntwo medicine bags from Neil Hicks, owner of Indian Territory, Tucson, \\nAZ. Mr. Hicks told the Agent at the time of purchase that all items \\nwere ``Navajo Medicine items.\\'\\' Following the execution of a federal \\nsearch warrant in November 1996, Special Agents of the U.S. Fish  \\nWildlife Service recovered the Navajo medicine items listed above. On \\nJune 25, 1998, Mr. Neil Hicks, DBA Indian Territory, pled guilty to \\nselling Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the \\nNative American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (Title 18 USC, \\nSection 1173).\\n    These cultural items were purchased by Mr. Hicks from person(s) \\nunknown who obtained these items in voilation of the Act. Consultation \\nevidence presented by representatives of the Navajo Nation indicate \\nthat the Lightning Way is one of twelve major chants still performed in \\nthe Navajo Nation. Bundles for these Ways should only be in the \\npossession of a qualified Hataalii (chanter, singer, or medicine \\nperson) capable of understanding the jish. In Navajo tradition, jish is \\nonly cared for or possessed by a human being, it is not ``property\\'\\' \\ncapable of being ``owned\\'\\' in the Western meanings of the words.\\n    Officials of the U.S. Fish  Wildlife Service have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(4), these 41 cultural items have ongoing \\nhistorical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the culture \\nitself, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by \\nany individual. Officials of the U.S. Fish  Wildlife Service have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nitems and the Navajo Nation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Navajo Nation. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these objects should contact Kevin Ellis, \\nSpecial Agent, Office of Law Enforcement, U.S. Fish  Wildlife Service, \\n26 N. MacDonald, Room 105, Mesa, AZ 85201; telephone: (602) 835-8289 \\nbefore November 2, 1998. Repatriation of these objects to the Navajo \\nNation may begin after that date if no additional claimants come \\nforward.\\n\\n    Dated: September 28, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
