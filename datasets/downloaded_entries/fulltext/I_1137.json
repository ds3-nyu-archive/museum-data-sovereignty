The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington; Cowlitz Indian Tribe, Washington; Hoh Indian Tribe of the Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington; Jamestown S\\'Klallam Tribe of Washington; Lower Elwha Tribal Community of the Lower Elwha Reservation, Washington; Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation, Washington; Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington; Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington; Nisqually Indian Tribe of the Nisqually Reservation, Washington; Nooksack Indian Tribe of Washington; Port Gamble Indian Community of the Port Gamble Reservation, Washington; Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington; Quileute Tribe of the Quileute Reservation, Washington; Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, Washington; Samish Indian Tribe, Washington; Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington; Shoalwater Bay Tribe of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation, Washington; Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington; Snoqualmie Tribe, Washington; Squaxin Island Tribe of the Squaxin Island Reservation, Washington; Stillaguamish Tribe of Washington; Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, Washington; Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation, Washington; Tulalip Tribes of the Tulalip Reservation, Washington; and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe of Washington (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). In addition, the Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound professional staff consulted with the following non-Federally recognized Indian groups: Chinook Tribe, Duwamish Tribe, Kikiallus Nation, Marietta Band of Nooksack Indians, Snohomish Tribe, Snoqualmoo Tribe, and Steilacoom Indian Tribe (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Indian Groups\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound received responses from the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington; Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington; and the Squaxin Island Tribe of the Squaxin Island Reservation, Washington. Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington requested a status report on the disposition of the remains, but made no claim for disposition. The Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington, and Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington, submitted a NAGPRA claim for the individual described in this Notice of Inventory Completion. The Squaxin Island Tribe of the Squaxin Island Reservation, Washington, supported the disposition of the individual to these two Indian tribes.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        At an unknown date prior to 1970, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWestern Washington.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The remains were stored at the University of Puget Sound\\'s Department of Comparative Sociology since at least the 1970s. In late Fall 2006 the remains were transferred to the Slater Museum by University staff. There is no record of the excavator, donor, date of removal, or exact provenience, except for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWestern Washington.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Elements present include a cranium and a mandible. No cranial deformation is present and the mandible is missing five teeth postmortem. The remains are overall very clean and of a dark mottled coloration. Small roots are present in the nasal cavity and sediments are found endocranially, suggesting the individual was likely removed from an archeological context. Slight cortical exfoliation is present on both the cranium and mandible, indicating the individual was buried in a taphonomic environment characterized by alternating dry and wet conditions. Based on 14 morphological characteristics, a physical anthropologist determined the remains represent a (possibly) male individual 40-60 years old and of Native American ancestry (Gill 1998; Rhine 1990). Additionally, the very even and severe enamel wear indicate the mastication of population-specific coarse foods that characterized the diets of pre-contact and post-contact Native American populations (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). These characteristics, in addition to the Slater Museum\\'s limited information, indicate that the individual is of Native American ancestry. The remains may have been removed from any location within Western Washington, which is considered by the Museum to include the 19 counties located between the Pacific Ocean and the Cascade Mountains. These include: Clallam, Clark, Cowlitz, Grays Harbor, Island, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, Pierce, San Juan, Skagit, Skamania, Snohomish, Thurston, Wahkiakum, and Whatcom Counties.\\n        Determinations Made by the Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound\\n        Officials of the Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission, the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Multiple lines of evidence, including treaties, Acts of Congress, and Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes and The Indian Groups.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Other credible lines of evidence, indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes and The Indian Groups.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains is to the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington, and Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains or any other Indian tribe that believes it satisfies the criteria in 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1) should contact Peter Wimberger, Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound, 1500 North Warner St., Tacoma, WA 98416-1088, telephone (253) 879-2784, before August 22, 2011.
