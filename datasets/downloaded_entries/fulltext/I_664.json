The human remains were removed from site 5WL48, in Weld County, CO.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by History Colorado professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma (formerly the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma); Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Oglala Sioux Tribe (previously listed as the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota); Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah; and Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota and the Shoshone Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming, were invited to consult but did not participate.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1974, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from site 5WL58 in Weld County, CO. Staff and students from the University of Northern Colorado inadvertently removed the human remains while excavating the site as part of a field school. The human remains were highly fragmentary and in 1974, thought to be faunal remains. The remains were identified as human in 2012, by History Colorado staff, who were processing the faunal assemblage. The human remains were transferred to the Culture and Community Department of the museum for NAGPRA compliance. Osteological analysis indicates the partial human remains represent three subadults of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Radiocarbon dates from the site where the human remains were removed ranges from 250 B.C. to A.D. 950. These dates, along with attributes of the site including site location on the northeastern plains of Colorado, projectile points, cord-marked pottery, and site architecture, indicate a Plains Woodland occupation. Available evidence indicates there is a traditional association between the Ute people and the geographical area from where the human remains were recovered. Ancestral Ute people may have interacted with Plains Woodland people on the northeastern plains of Colorado. However the preponderance of evidence including geographical, biological, archeological, oral tradition, and expert opinion is associated with Plains Woodlands occupations whose descendants are currently recognized as the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; and Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma.\\n        Determinations Made by History Colorado\\n        Officials of History Colorado have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; and Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco & Tawakonie), Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Sheila Goff, NAGPRA Liaison, History Colorado, 1200 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203, telephone (303) 866-4531, email sheila.goff@state.co.us, by July 9, 2015.
