The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from near Camp Verde, Yavapai County, AZ.\\n\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Heard Museum professional staff in consultation with representatives of Ak-Chin Indian Community (previously listed as the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona); Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai Reservation, Arizona); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1972, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from near Camp Verde in Yavapai County, AZ by Tim Bailey. The human remains are of a child of unknown gender. They were donated to the Heard Museum in 1973, at which time they were assigned the catalog numbers NA-SW-SG-A2-1 and NA-SW-SG-K-2. No known individuals were identified. The 19 associated funerary objects are: One bowl, one pottery sherd, one bead, three fragments of an obsidian tool, two quartzite flakes, 10 animal bones, and one corn cob.\\n        The bowl was identified as Flagstaff Black-on-white. The vessel was re-attributed as Puebloan based on Wood\\'s classification of this type as an Anasazi type (Wood 1987:98). The cultural affiliation of the human remains was changed to Hohokam based on the presence of cremated bone and obsidian lithics. The bowl is a Puebloan pottery type. Possibly, it was a trade item. Alternatively, it is associated with the burial of a Hohokam person outside of his/her culture area whose religious convictions were respected upon death (see Wilcox 1987:135). Based on the cremated bone and pottery type of the cremation vessel, the human remains are not likely to be Sinagua.\\n        The Hohokam lived in central and southern Arizona from about A.D. 1 to 1450. The style of pottery known as Flagstaff Black-on-white was made by Ancestral Puebloans and dates from A.D. 1130 to 1230. In 1990, the Ak-Chin Indian Community, Gila River Indian Community, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Community, and Tohono O\\'odham Nation adopted a joint statement asserting their cultural affiliation to ancestors described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHohokam.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In 1994, the Hopi Tribe asserted its cultural affiliation to Hohokam and Hisatsinom (Puebloan). In 1995, the Pueblo of Zuni asserted its cultural affiliation to Hohokam and Puebloan. In 1995, the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe asserted its cultural affiliation to human remains found near the area of Montezuma Well (near Camp Verde).\\n        Determinations Made by the Heard Museum\\n        Officials of the Heard Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 19 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and Ak-Chin Indian Community (previously listed as the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona); Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Havasupai Tribe of the Havasupai Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Hualapai Indian Tribe of the Hualapai Indian Reservation, Arizona; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona; Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Yavapai-Prescott Tribe of the Yavapai Reservation, Arizona); and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to David Roche, Director/CEO, Heard Museum, 2301 North Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85004, telephone (602) 252-8840, email director@heard.org, by October 10, 2018.
