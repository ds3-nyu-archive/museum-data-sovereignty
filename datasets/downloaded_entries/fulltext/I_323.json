The individual was transferred to the Utah Museum of Natural History in 1973. The highly fragmented remains of a juvenile\\'s mandible and several teeth were recovered from a pit in a room block on a Virgin Branch Puebloan site, which had at least two occupations dating from A.D. 1050-1300. The circumstances of the burial suggest that the pit was not intended for the individual and that the partial human remains washed or blew into the pit after the site\\'s abandonment. No associated funerary objects were identified. No known individuals were identified.\\n\\n        In addition to the Virgin Branch Puebloan occupation, the Southern Paiute have occupied the immediate area since A.D. 1400, possibly earlier.
