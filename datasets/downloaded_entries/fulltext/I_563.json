This area was Kickapoo land from 1832 to 1854. The association of a string of glass beads indicated a relatively recent burial. The human remains consist of a cranium and an associated mandible. The cranium was determined to be that of a 20-30 year old male of mixed ancestry. No known individuals were identified.
