Site CA-FRE-105 was encountered at the bottom of a waste way at its juncture with the main canal. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaterial (was) scooped up from 7 feet deep in wet clay, from an area that was approximately 200 yards in diameter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The site record describes the site as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclay soil containing human remains and artifacts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Human remains and artifacts were collected by Robert E. Greengo of the University of California, Berkeley, and acquired by the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, through University Appropriation in 1951 (Accession UCAS-314). The human remains from Site CA-FRE-105 consist of three partially complete Native American individuals, including one possible male adolescent (approximately 15-20 years) and two adults of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are: one greywacke sandstone slab mortar fragment, one large obsidian flake and one unmodified faunal long bone. An additional associated funerary object, a large obsidian point, is currently missing from the collection.\\n        In 1952, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from Site CA-FRE-106, Fresno County, CA, by M.A. Baumhoff of the University of California, Berkeley, and were acquired through University Appropriation in June 1952 (Accession UCAS-157). Museum records describe nearly complete remains of two individuals recovered from a vertically truncated midden site. Individual 1 is an adult female and Individual 2 is an adult male. Both burials were excavated and exhumed, and three additional burials were noted but left in situ. No known individuals were identified. The two associated funerary objects are one large, extensively-shaped greywacke sandstone bowl mortar and one unmodified deer rib bone.\\n        Geographical affiliation is consistent with the historically documented territory of the Northern Valley Yokut. Multiple lines of evidence including oral tradition, ethnographic, archeological, historic, and linguistic information demonstrate continuity and a shared group identity between the human remains and associated funerary objects in this notice and the Yokut tribes. No lineal descendant has been identified. The Tribes identify as Yokut, and are culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects in this notice.\\n        Determinations Made by the Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Regional Office\\n        Officials of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Regional Office, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of five individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the five objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Melanie Ryan, NAGPRA Specialist/Physical Anthropologist, Mid-Pacific Regional Office, Bureau of Reclamation, MP-153, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, CA 95825, telephone (916) 978-5526, email emryan@usbr.gov, by October 10, 2018.
