The human remains and associated funerary objects were taken from burial pits within and near the site. Some of the burial had been disturbed variously, by intentional looting and excavation by professional archeologists before burial law protection had been enacted. Burial 1 consists of one adult represented by 38 skeletal elements. Burial 2 consists of one adult represented by fragmentary cranial bones, phalanges, mandible fragments, long bone diaphysis, and teeth. Burial 3 consists of one adult male represented by 74 badly damaged and decomposed cranial elements, long bones, and scapula, clavicle, and pelvic elements. Burial 4 consists of one adult represented by fragmented long bones and a patella. Burial 5 consists of one adult female represented by over 140 small bone fragments that include one pelvic fragment and several identifiable long bone fragments. Burial 6 consists of one four-to-six month old infant represented by 15 bone fragments and two teeth. Burial 7 consists of seven element fragments. No known individuals were identified.
