The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        At an unknown date, six cultural items were removed from multiple unknown locations. In the 1950s, Karen Petersen and her husband Sydney Petersen spent their summers visiting Anishinaabe communities, camping out, and buying crafts from tribal members. When she was able to sell items, she sold them through churches in St. Paul, MN. She also collected Anishinaabe objects for the Science Museum of Minnesota as a staff member from 1958 to 1964. The six cultural items were purchased by Petersen in 1975 from unknown collectors who obtained or purchased them from tribal members at the White Earth Indian Reservation in northwestern Minnesota. The baton (AC.11531) was obtained by an unknown collector from Annie Fineday of the White Earth Indian Reservation in 1941, and, in turn, was obtained by Petersen in 1975. It was purchased by Francis and Mary Crane on February 5, 1976. The Cranes donated the baton to the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS) in December of 1976. The bird carving (AC.11532) was purchased by an unknown collector from Mrs. John Basswood in Ponsford, which is part of the White Earth Indian Reservation, in 1949. It was obtained by Petersen in 1975 and was purchased by the Cranes on February 5, 1976. The Cranes donated the bird carving to the DMNS in December of 1976. The rattle (AC.11534) was sold to an unknown collector by Jack Saylor at the White Earth Indian Reservation, and, in turn, was purchased by Petersen in 1975, and by the Cranes on February 5, 1976. The Cranes donated the rattle to the DMNS in December of 1976. The medicine bag (AC.11535H) was obtained from Mrs. Moose Jonas from an unknown collector in the 1930s, and, in turn, was obtained by Petersen in 1975. It was purchased by the Cranes on February 5, 1976. The Cranes donated the medicine bag to the DMNS in December of 1976. The second bird figure (AC.11540) was obtained from Annie Fineday by an unknown collector in 1941, and, in turn, was obtained by Petersen in 1975. It was purchased by the Cranes on February 5, 1976. The Cranes donated the bird figure to the DMNS in December of 1976. The Midewiwin Post (AC.11543) was purchased from Mrs. John Basswood in Ponsford in 1949, and, in turn, was obtained by Petersen in 1975. It was purchased by the Cranes on February 5, 1976. The Cranes then donated the Midewiwin Post to the DMNS in December of 1976. The six cultural items are one Midewiwin baton (AC.11531), two Midewiwin bird figures (AC.11532 and AC.11540), one Midewiwin rattle (AC.11534), one Midewiwin medicine bag (AC.11534H), and one Midewiwin post (AC.11534). The cultural items are identified in museum records as being from the White Earth Indian Reservation in northwestern Minnesota. Bird figures and their posts are used to mark Mide lodges and to signify a family or society affiliation. Similarly, rattles, medicine bags, and batons have an integral role in Midewiwin\\'s current ceremonial practices.\\n        Museum accession, catalogue, and documentary records, as well as consultation with representatives of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota, indicate that the six cultural items are Ojibwe and are from the White Earth Indian Reservation, Minnesota. The six cultural items, AC.11531, AC.11532, AC.11534, AC.11535H, AC.11540, and AC.11543, relate to the Grand Medicine Society or Midewiwin, a ritual society.\\n        Determinations Made by the Denver Museum of Nature & Science\\n        Officials of the Denver Museum of Nature & Science have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the six cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the cultural items and the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Minnesota.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Chip Colwell, Senior Curator of Anthropology and NAGPRA Officer, Denver Museum of Nature & Science, 2001 Colorado Boulevard, Denver, CO 80205, telephone (303) 370-6378, email Chip.Colwell@dmns.org by April 6, 2017.
