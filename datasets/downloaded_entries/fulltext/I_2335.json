No known individuals were identified. The \\ntwelve associated funerary objects recovered with these human remains \\ninclude Sackett corded sherds, a Carpenter Brook rim sherd, a shell-\\ntempered rim sherds with catellation, and two cord-marked body sherds. \\nThese associated funerary object have not been located in the \\ncollections of the Tioga County Historical Society.\\n    Based on the apparent age of the human remains and presence of \\nassociated funerary objects, these individuals have been determined to \\nbe Native American. Based on the ceramic styles (Sackett [Farm] corded, \\nCarpenter Brook,  rim sherds with castellations], the burials date to \\n1100-1450 A.D. Archeological evidence for this geographic area \\nindicates these ceramic styles fit into the material culture continuum \\nfor the development of Cayuga ceramics.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Tioga \\nCounty Historical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Tioga \\nCounty Historical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the \\nCayuga Nation of New York.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Cayuga Nation of New \\nYork, the Oneida Nation of New York, the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin, the \\nOnondaga Nation of New York, Seneca Nation of New York, the Seneca-\\nCayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community of Mohican \\nIndians of Wisconsin, the St. Regis Band of Mohawk Indians of New York, \\nand the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians of New York.
