The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        At unknown dates between 1951 and 1952, Julia K. Shishkin purchased eight cultural items from a member of the Pueblo of Nambe in Santa Fe County, NM. On April 30, 1964, Mrs. Shishkin offered to sell the eight items to the School of American Research for two-hundred dollars. On May 14, 1964, the Executive Committee of the School of American Research (School for Advanced Research was formerly School of American Research until 2007) examined the eight items from the Pueblo of Nambe and subsequently purchased them on May 15, 1964. The eight cultural items are 1 large stone figure (SAR.1964-3A); 1 set of black feathers tied together with string (SAR.1964-3BC), which are to be attached to the SAR.1964-3A stone figure; 5 stone figures with leather carrying pouches (SAR.1964-4AB, SAR.1964-5AB, SAR.1964-6AB, SAR.1964-7AB, SAR.1964-8AB); and 1 small stone with rough surface on one side, and polished opaque surface on the other (SAR.1964-9).\\n        On November 15, 1993, the School of American Research, Indian Arts Research Center sent a summary of objects to the Pueblo of Nambe in accordance to the reporting requirements of NAGPRA. On January 20, 2012, a representative from the Pueblo of Nambe contacted the School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center via phone requesting another report of objects in the School\\'s collection. On January 23, 2012, a report of Nambe objects with photos was sent via email to the Pueblo of Nambe representative. Correspondence and consultation followed thereafter regarding the eight cultural items listed in this notice. The review of the School for Advanced Research\\'s documentation, in addition to physical inspections by Pueblo of Nambe representatives, has resulted in confirmation from the Pueblo of Nambe traditional leaders that the eight items are of Pueblo of Nambe origin, supporting cultural affiliation as well as determining that the eight items are sacred objects. The School for Advanced Research, Indian Arts Research Center records, including catalog cards and other provenance information indicate these items to be of Pueblo of Nambe origin, further supporting the claim by the Pueblo of Nambe.
