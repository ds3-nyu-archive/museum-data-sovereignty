The legally authorized excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona under the direction of Terah L Smiley. At the end of excavations, the archeological collections were brought the Arizona State Museum (ASM) and assigned accession numbers. The four unassociated funerary objects are four lots of glass beads.\\n        Site AZ BB:13:6(ASM) is a multicomponent habitation and agricultural site. In the 1690s, Father Eusebio Kino traveled through southern Arizona and reported the presence of a Piman village on the west bank of the Santa Cruz River near Sentinel Peak. He named this village San Cosme de Tucson after Chuk-son, the Piman name for the village. By the early years of the 18th century, a visita was established at San Cosme as an extension of the mission of San Xavier Del Bac, located a few miles to the south. Priests from San Xavier would come to the visita occasionally to conduct baptisms and other rites for the village inhabitants. Beginning in the early 1770\\'s construction began on more permanent facilities. The mission complex, renamed San Agust\\xc3\\xacn, eventually included a chapel, a two-story convent building, an orchard, a granary, and a cemetery for the Native American population. The mission was in use until the middle of the 19th century. Historical records indicate that Sections A and B of the cemetery were used for the internment of baptized Native Americans who were the inhabitants of the O\\'odham village. The O\\'odham people today are comprised of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona, Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona, and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Determinations Made by the Arizona State Museum\\n        Officials of the ASM have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 4 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to John McClelland, NAGPRA Coordinator, P.O.
