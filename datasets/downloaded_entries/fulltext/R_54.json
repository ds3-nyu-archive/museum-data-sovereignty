No known individuals were identified. Two hand painted semi-porcelain tea cup fragments (re-fit into one object) were located with human tibiae fragments and interpreted as representing a burial. The tibiae fragments were not located in the collection during a NAGPRA inventory in 1995, nor during a re-inventory in 2004, and may not have been collected at the time of excavation. The one unassociated funerary object consists of the two teacup fragments re-fit into a whole object.\\n        The burial was located within the region historically occupied by The Chickasaw Nation. Two other burials were recovered at 34JN30 and were repatriated to The Chickasaw Nation in accordance with NAGPRA in 2013 (78 FR 27995-27996, 05/13/2013). Those burials conformed to the burial practices of the Chickasaw as seen in ethnographic data, including the placement of grave goods on top of the burial with sheets of bark. The third burial, represented by the tibiae fragments and broken teacup, was located 25 feet from the other two and can reasonably be assumed to be associated with the same site. The temporal placement of this site in the mid-1800s was based on the archaeological seriation of historic artifacts from the burials and larger site assemblage.\\n        Determinations Made by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District\\n        Officials of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the one cultural item described above is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary object and The Chickasaw Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Michelle Horn, CESWT-ODR-N, US Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, 2488 East 81st Street, Tulsa, OK 74137-4290, telephone (918) 669-7642, email Michelle.C.Horn@usace.army.mil, by March 26, 2018.
