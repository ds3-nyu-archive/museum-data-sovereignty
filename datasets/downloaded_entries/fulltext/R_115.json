The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Item\\n\\n        At an unknown date before 1973, one sacred object was removed from Zuni lands, most likely from a location in New Mexico. The sacred object is a cottonwood cylinder, 71 cm. long and 23.7 cm. in diameter. It is rounded at both ends and carved to resemble a human figure with a face, ears, hair and cap or helmet at one end and hands at the other end. There is a hole in the front center at a place where some scholars suggest is an umbilicus. The wood is significantly weathered and shows signs of aging. Based upon the form and condition, the object has been determined to be a Zuni Ahayu:da or war god.\\n        In 1973, the sacred object (Ahayu:da) was donated by an individual to Albion College. There is no further information regarding its origin or date. After the donor\\'s death in 1990, Bille Wickre contacted the donor\\'s children and grandchildren in an effort to find out more about the Ahayu:da, but no one remembered anything about it. Once the Ahayu:da was discovered in the collection, Bille Wickre and students of Albion College undertook a research project to authenticate the object. Written and visual evidence suggested the object is an Ahayu:da. Wickre telephoned the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, to initiate consultation. She spoke with Kurt Dongoske, RPA, Principal Investigator and Tribal Historic Preservation Officer.
