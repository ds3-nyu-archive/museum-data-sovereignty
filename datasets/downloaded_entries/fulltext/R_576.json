The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural items.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        The 20 cultural items are 14 olivella shell beads, 3 natural quartz crystals, 1 ceramic pipe fragment, 1 rabbit bone bead fragment, and 1 fragment of incised shell.\\n        The 20 cultural items objects were excavated from site CA-SDI-12809, located near Otay Ranch, 4 miles east of Chula Vista, CA.  Site CA-SDI-12809 was first excavated by archeologist Dr. Charlotte McGowan from Southwestern Community College, Chula Vista, CA, in 1971. It is reported that inhumations were discovered at that time and were repatriated to the Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California.  In 1993, California Department of Transportation, District 11 contracted Brian F. Mooney & Associates to excavate the site for construction of State Route 125, part of the SR 125-South Otay Valley Project.  During the 1993 excavations, inhumations and artifacts were discovered at several locations. The archeology report states that the human remains were reinterred at that time \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the direction of a Native American observer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The artifacts from the 1993 collection were taken to the San Diego Archaeological Center on August 8, 2000. The unassociated funerary objects were discovered during the sorting and classifying of artifacts from CA-SDI-12809.\\n        Archeological evidence, including artifacts typical of the late Prehistoric period (3500 B.P. to circa A.D. 1700) indicates that the site described above is Native American.  Archeological and historical literature, and oral historical evidence presented during consultation, confirm that site CA-SDI-12809 is located within traditional and historical Kumeyaay territory.  The site is thought to be Otai Village, a late Prehistoric-period Kumeyaay village abandoned during the Historic period.   The cultural items described above are believed to be associated with known burials found at the site because of their proximity to the burials and their intensely burned condition. The cultural items are also typically associated with burial practices of the Kumeyaay.\\n\\n        Officials of the San Diego Archaeological Center have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B), the cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.  Officials of the San Diego Archaeological Center also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, California; Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Ewiiaapaayp Band of Kumeyaay Indians, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary objects should contact Cindy Stankowski, Director, San Diego Archaeological Center, 16666 San Pasqual Valley Road, Escondido, CA 92027, before April 26, 2004.
