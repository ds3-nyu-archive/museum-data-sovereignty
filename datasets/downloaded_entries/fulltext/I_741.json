These human remains were collected by Mollie Ward Greist, a native of Indiana who lived in Barrow, AK, from 1921-1936. The human remains were transferred to the Indiana University Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology in 1956, to the Mathers Museum of World Cultures in 1972, and then to the Department of Anthropology in 1990. The 1 associated funerary object is a fragment of oil soaked wood. No known individuals were identified.

Accounts of Inupiat burials indicate that the human remains were placed into very shallow graves or were surface burials. Inupiat mortuary treatments also involved deceased individuals being wrapped in skins or furs and taken to a cemetery where they were placed on wood planks. Mollie Greist reported seeing hundreds of Native American skeletons lying on the ground near Point Barrow.
