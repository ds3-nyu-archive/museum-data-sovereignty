The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects.  The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of human remains was made by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Bering Straits Native Corporation, the Unalakleet Native Corporation, and the Native Village of Unalakleet.\\n        In 1869, human remains representing one individual were collected from Norton Sound, AK, by William H. Dall, who donated these human remains to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in the same year.  No known individual was identified.  No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology documentation describes the remains as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnaleet [sic], Eskimo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Given the proximity of Norton Sound to the village of Unalakleet, the human remains are probably from Unalakleet.  Historical documents and consultation information indicate that the Native Village of Unalakleet has traditionally occupied the area from which the human remains were collected.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d) (1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.  Officials of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Native Village of Unalakleet.\\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Native Village of Unalakleet, Unalakleet Native Corporation, and Bering Straits Native Corporation.  Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Patricia Capone, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, 11 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, telephone (617) 496-3702, before April 24, 2002. Repatriation of the human remains to the Native Village of Unalakleet may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        \\n          Dated: February 5, 2002.\\n          Robert Stearns,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 02-7007 Filed 3-22-02; 8:45 am]\\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-S\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA", "agency2": "National Park Service, Interior.
