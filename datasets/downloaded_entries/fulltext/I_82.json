The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from site AR-03-03-02-536 (LA79663), Mt. Taylor Ranger District, Cibola National Forest and National Grasslands, Cibola County, NM.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Cibola National Forest professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Between 1980 and 1991, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from site AR-03-03-02-536 (LA79663) in Cibola County, NM. Based on reports, site forms, and other notes found in the Forest\\'s heritage resource files, the site experienced several episodes of rodent damage and vandalism (pot hunting) over a period of 11 years (1980-1991). The initial damage to the site was noted in July 1980. At that time, 18 human bones or fragments of bones were observed in two midden features, and were collected by Forest Service archeological staff. The site form from that time indicates that the bones were likely brought to the surface as a result of rodent activity. The skeletal remains consist of four long bones, six ribs or rib fragments, seven vertebrae, and one sacrum, and represent the partial skeletons of two Native American individuals of unknown sex and age. No known individuals were identified.\\n        Damage to site AR-03-03-02-536 (LA79663) from pot hunting was noted in 199l, and the site was subsequently monitored more frequently, until an individual was discovered digging within a room block at the site, resulting in an investigation in September 1991. During the course of the investigation, 12 artifacts collected by the individual were seized by a Forest Service Law Enforcement officer. In June 2008, evidence of new disturbance (pot hunting) was observed at the site. As part of the damage assessment, the Forest Service archeologist screened soil from two holes, and recovered additional items (ceramic sherds, flaked stone, small pieces of charcoal and adobe, and seven small pieces of faunal bone). The 63 associated funerary objects are 19 ceramic sherds, 13 pieces of flaked stone, 10 pieces of charcoal, 14 pieces of adobe, and seven small fragments of faunal remains.\\n\\n        Site AR-03-03-02-536 (LA79663) is a small masonry pueblo that is estimated to date between A.D. 900 and 1100.

During consultation, the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico Historic Preservation Office confirmed it, too, considers the eastern half of the Zuni Mountains part of its aboriginal land base.
