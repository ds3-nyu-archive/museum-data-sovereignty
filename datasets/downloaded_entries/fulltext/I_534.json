The human remains were removed from Greene County, TN, Altamaha River Basin, GA, and eastern Georgia.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Georgia State University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Cherokee Nation; the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. The following tribes were contacted, but either declined consultation or did not respond: The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; The Chickasaw Nation; the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town; the Poarch Band of Creek Indians (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); and the Thlopthlocco Tribal Town. All tribes in this section are hereafter referred to as The Consulted and Invited Tribes.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        Between 1970 and 1975, human remains representing, at minimum, nine individuals were removed from an unknown site, probably in eastern Georgia. The human remains are thought to have been excavated by Antonio J. Waring. Evidence of head binding circumstantially agrees with the known Native American context of this excavation. All of Waring\\'s excavations took place in the Southeastern United States, with the majority in eastern Georgia. Geographic evidence suggests these human remains are either Creek or Cherokee. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Between 1970 and 1980, human remains representing, at minimum, eight individuals were removed from site 40GN9 in Greene County, TN. Site 40GN9, a Middle Qualla site, was excavated by an unknown person, and transferred on an unknown date to Georgia State University. Geographic evidence suggests these human remains to be Cherokee, and likely from the town of Canasoga or Canasahaqui. These human remains are determined to be Native American based on the cultural and geographic documentation. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In March of 1971, human remains representing, at minimum, six individuals were removed from the Altamaha River basin, McIntosh County, GA. These human remains were removed by the late Dr. Wharton of the GSU Biology department, and received into custody at Georgia State University. The human remains were identified by Dr. Wharton as Native American. Geographical and archeological evidence suggests that these human remains are Native American, and likely Creek or Yamassee. No known individuals were identified.
