The human remains were removed from Skagit County, WA. \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Oregon State University Department of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of Jamestown S\\'Klallam Tribe of Washington; Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington; Samish Indian Tribe, Washington; and Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation, Washington. \\n        On unknown dates, human remains representing a minimum of two individuals were removed from Similk Bay and LaConner Flats, Skagit County, WA. The human remains were donated to the Department of Anthropology by Dr. T. Tillman of the Oregon State University Physical Education Department upon his retirement. Dr. Tillman received the human remains from the widow of an unknown collector between 1940 and 1978. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        The collection records state that both individuals are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the Department of Anthropology\\'s physical anthropology faculty confirms that both skulls have cranial modification consistent with Native American cultural practices. According to collection records and tribal consultants, the human remains were removed from locations in the traditional and current territory of the Swinhomish Indians of the Swinhomish Reservation, Washington. \\n        Officials of the Oregon State University Department of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Oregon State University Department of Anthropology have also determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation, Washington. \\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Dr. David McMurray, Oregon State University Department of Anthropology, 238 Waldo Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331, telephone (541) 737-4515, before April 30, 2008. Repatriation of the human remains to the Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation, Washington may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n\\n        Oregon State University Department of Anthropology is responsible for notifying the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Cowlitz Indian Tribe, Washington; Hoh Indian Tribe of the Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington; Kalispel Indian Community of the Kalispel Reservation, Washington; Lower Elwha Tribal Community of the Lower Elwha Reservation, Washington; Lummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation, Washington; Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, Washington; Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington; Nisqually Indian Tribe of the Nisqually Reservation, Washington; Nooksack Indian Tribe of Washington; Port Gamble Indian Community of the Port Gamble Reservation, Washington; Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington; Quileute Tribe of the Quileute Reservation, Washington; Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation, Washington; Samish Indian Tribe, Washington; Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe of Washington; Shoalwater Bay Tribe of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation, Washington; Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington; Snoqualmie Tribe, Washington; Spokane Tribe of the Spokane Reservation, Washington; Squaxin Island Tribe of the Squaxin Island Reservation, Washington; Stillaguamish Tribe of Washington; Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, Washington; Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation, Washington; Tulalip Tribes of the Tulalip Reservation, Washington; and Upper Skagit Indian Tribe of Washington that this notice has been published. \\n        \\n          Dated: March 5, 2008. \\n          David Tarler, \\n          Acting Manager, National NAGPRA Program. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
