Records of the removal provide substantive evidence that the human remains and associated funerary object were recovered from a prehistoric archeological site. Due to the interspersed nature of the private and state land parcels in this area and the casual nature of the excavation records, it is not possible to accurately establish the location of the site from which they were removed. In 1981, the human remains and associated funerary object were donated to the Museum of Northern Arizona. The associate funerary object is one ceramic vessel.\\n        The human remains and associated funerary object were removed from a site related to the Northern Sinagua archeological culture. The Museum of Northern Arizona is using the cultural affiliation study completed by the USDA Forest Service in 1996 for prehistoric archeological remains in Coconino County, AZ, including lands directly adjacent to this site. Based on evidence relevant to archeological, anthropological, biological, geographical, oral traditions/folklore and kinship, the USDA Forest Service established that the Northern Sinagua were most closely affiliated with the modern Hopi Tribe of Arizona. In reviewing the 1996 USDA cultural affiliation study, as well as pertinent literature in the site records at the Museum of Northern Arizona and a study of the human remains and associated funerary object, the Museum of Northern Arizona concurs that the objects are most closely affiliated with the modern Hopi Tribe of Arizona.\\n        Determinations Made by the Museum of Northern Arizona\\n        Officials of the Museum of Northern Arizona have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the one object described in this notice is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary object and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and funerary object should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Elaine Hughes, Collection Manager, Museum of Northern Arizona, 3103 North Fort Valley Road, Flagstaff, AZ 86001, telephone (928) 774-5211, email ehughes@mna.mus.az.us, by June 16, 2014.
