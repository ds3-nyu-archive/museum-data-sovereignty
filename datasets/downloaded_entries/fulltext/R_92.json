Howard, Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent at the White Earth Agency from 1908 to 1916, and given to Warren K. Moorehead. The two sacred objects are one large granite pipe and associated long wooden stem (object ID number 29661) that had been made and smoked by Bay-bah-daum-ay-aush in 1898; and one small effigy pipe (object ID number 29662) belonging to No-de-na-qua-um (also known as Temperance Chief).\\n        In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Warren K.

After his appointment, Moorehead learned from his colleagues at the Smithsonian Institution \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof the dreadful situation on a dozen different reservations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d including the White Earth Reservation. He requested permission and funds to investigate, which were granted by Commissioner of Indian Affairs Francis Leupp. Moorehead spent time at the White Earth Reservation investigating various forms of land and other theft during a period of significant economic, cultural, and religious oppression.
