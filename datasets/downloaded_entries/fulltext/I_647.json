The human remains were removed by Jane Durken near the old Eldon Hotel and donated to the Burke Museum in 1963 (Burke Accn. #1963-36). No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is an unmodified shell.\\n        The human remains are consistent with Native American morphology and therefore have been determined to be Native American. Lilliwap and the surrounding area is within the traditional aboriginal territory of the Twana people (Elmendorf 1960, Mooney 1896, Smith 1940, Suttle 1990). Three subgroups of the Twana are identifiable: The Skokomish, the Duhelelips, and the Kolsids (Brown 1986). The Indian Claims Commission ruled that all of Hood Canal, WA, was the traditional aboriginal territory of the Twana (Skokomish) people. The Twana are represented by the modern day Skokomish Indian Tribe Skokomish Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington). The Skokomish were signatories to the 1855 Treaty of Point-No-Point.\\n        Determinations Made by the Burke Museum\\n        Officials of the Burke Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the one object described in this notice is reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission or the Court of Federal Claims, the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of the Skokomish Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington).\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary object and the Skokomish Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Skokomish Indian Tribe of the Skokomish Reservation, Washington).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary object should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Peter Lape, Burke Museum, University of Washington, Box 353010, Seattle, WA 98195, telephone (206) 685-3849 x2, email plape@uw.edu, by November 2, 2015.
