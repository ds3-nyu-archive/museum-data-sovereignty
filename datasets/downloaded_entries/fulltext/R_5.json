The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the Brooklyn Museum. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        The five cultural items described in this notice were accessioned by the Brooklyn Museum between 1901 and 1967. The five objects include three ceramic vessels and two pieces of dance regalia. Information on the ceremonial roles of the objects is based on consultation that took place at the Brooklyn Museum on November 28, 2018, and through later written correspondence.\\n        One ceramic pitcher was collected in 1879 by Colonel James Stevenson at the Pueblo of Tesuque. In 1880, the pitcher entered the collection of the U.S. National Museum. It was transferred to the Brooklyn Museum in 1901. The pitcher is decorated with white, black, and red pigments. Design elements include clouds, rain, corn, and crosshatched geometric patterns. Tesuque representatives stated that the pitcher was used in community ceremonies.\\n        One ceramic storage jar was collected by Captain C. W. Riggs, likely between 1876 and 1891. Riggs\\' catalog indicates that the jar was collected from the Pueblo of Cochiti. In 1902, the Brooklyn Museum purchased the storage jar along with a selection of other Pueblo pottery collected by Riggs. The jar is decorated with black designs\\xe2\\x80\\x94corn and circular motifs\\xe2\\x80\\x94on white pigment; the lower portion is painted red. While the jar was collected from the Pueblo of Cochiti, it\\'s solid lines (without ceremonial breaks), wide mouth and tapered lower half, lack of human and animal figures, and presence of floral motifs all support a Tesuque origin. Consultants from the Pueblo of Tesuque identified this jar as one that would have been owned and used by Tesuque\\'s Warrior Society.\\n        One buffalo hide robe was purchased by Brooklyn Museum curator Stewart Culin in 1907 from Benham Indian Trading Company in Albuquerque, NM, for $30. The trading company reported that the robe had been collected by Dr. Thomas S. Dozier, who said that it came from Tesuque. The painted design is of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbox-and-border\\xe2\\x80\\x9d type, which is found throughout the central Plains. Representatives from Tesuque said that this robe was used in the Comanche Dance and was likely purchased from Comanche traders for this purpose.\\n        One headdress made from hide, dyed hair, horn, and fabric was also purchased by Brooklyn Museum curator Stewart Culin in 1907 from Benham Indian Trading Company in Albuquerque, NM. The only information provided by the store was that the headdress was from Tesuque. Representatives said that this headdress, like the buffalo hide robe, was worn for the Comanche Dance.\\n        One seed bowl was purchased by Brooklyn resident J. L. Greason (1868-1967) when he was living in Oregon. The bowl was donated to the Brooklyn Museum by Greason\\'s estate after his death in early 1967. Mrs. A. Gordon, whose relation to Greason is unknown, corresponded with the Museum regarding the donation. The small bowl is covered with beige slip and is decorated with black feather designs around the rim. Tesuque consultants identified this as a ceremonial bowl used to hold seeds.\\n        Determinations Made by the Brooklyn Museum\\n        Officials of the Brooklyn Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the five cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(D), the five cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony and the Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W.
