The Office of the State Archaeologist was notified and conferred with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, and the landowner. Because the unmarked burial was threatened, the remains were disinterred and transferred to History Colorado. They are identified as Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 282. Osteological analysis determined the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. The five associated funerary objects are 1 round hammerstone, 2 bone pendants, 1 grayware pottery sherd, and 1 bone awl. The estimated antiquity is unknown.\\n        At an unknown date, a schoolteacher obtained human remains representing, at minimum, one individual. In 2011, after the teacher retired, his successor discovered the remains in the classroom and turned them over to Jefferson County law enforcement, who notified the Office of the State Archaeologist. The remains were transferred to History Colorado in December 2011. They are identified as OAHP Case Number 283. The location from which the remains were removed is not known. Osteological analysis determined that the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The estimated antiquity is unknown.\\n\\n        Sometime in 1987, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Park County, CO, although the exact location is unknown. In 1988, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Michael Charney, a former professor at Colorado State University. Dr. Charney\\'s analysis determined that they were not of forensic interest and that the remains are of Native American ancestry. He reported this to the Park County Coroner and retained the remains. In 1998, the remains were claimed as private property by the widow of Dr. Charney after his death. The human remains were subsequently taken into custody by the Larimer County Sheriff\\'s Office. Following litigation in 2006, the remains were inadvertently returned to Park County because the box they were in stated they were of forensic interest. In December 2011, the Park County Coroner discovered the error and transferred the remains to History Colorado, who had previously received a court order to repatriate all Native American human remains formerly in the possession of Dr. Charney, in accordance with Colorado State burial law and NAGPRA. They are identified as OAHP Case Number 284. Additional osteological analysis by History Colorado confirmed that the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The estimated antiquity is unknown.\\n        In August 2011, a private citizen reported a discovery of human remains representing, at minimum, one individual to the Clear Creek County coroner. They are identified as OAHP Case Number 285. They were found near the site of a house that had burned down in October 2010. The exact location of removal is unknown. The Office of the State Archaeologist was notified and the remains were transferred to History Colorado in December 2011. Osteological analysis determined that the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The estimated antiquity is unknown.\\n        Determinations Made by History Colorado\\n        Officials at History Colorado have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains described above and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the five objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near the individual human remains at the time of death or later as a part of the death rite ceremony.\\n\\n        History Colorado has determined that the human remains are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cculturally unidentifiable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under NAGPRA, 43 CFR 10.9 (e)(6). In 2006, History Colorado, in partnership with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, conducted consultations with the tribes that have ancestral ties to the state of Colorado to develop the process for disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from inadvertent discoveries on Colorado state and private lands. As a result of the consultation, a process was developed, titled Process for Consultation, Transfer, and Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating From Inadvertent Discoveries on Colorado State and Private Lands, (2008), (unpublished, on file with the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation).\\n\\n        OAHP 282 was recovered from Rio Blanco County, which is located in the Basin and Plateau Consultation Region, as established by the Process. Tribes with known aboriginal ties to this region and those who have asked to be notified of discoveries in the Basin and Plateau Consultation Region were invited to consult for OAHP 282. All tribes with ancestral ties to Colorado were invited to consult regarding OAHP 283-285, due to their vague provenience information.\\n\\n        The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. On November 3-4, 2006, the Process was presented to the Review Committee for consideration. A January 8, 2007, letter on behalf of the Review Committee from the Designated Federal Officer transmitted the provisional authorization to proceed with the Process upon receipt of formal responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, subject to forthcoming conditions imposed by the Secretary of the Interior. On May 15-16, 2008, the responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma were submitted to the Review Committee. On September 23, 2008, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, as the designee for the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains according to the Process and NAGPRA, pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.

The Office of the State Archaeologist was notified and conferred with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, and the landowner. Because the unmarked burial was threatened, the remains were disinterred and transferred to History Colorado. They are identified as Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) Case Number 282. Osteological analysis determined the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. The five associated funerary objects are 1 round hammerstone, 2 bone pendants, 1 grayware pottery sherd, and 1 bone awl. The estimated antiquity is unknown. \n At an unknown date, a schoolteacher obtained human remains representing, at minimum, one individual. In 2011, after the teacher retired, his successor discovered the remains in the classroom and turned them over to Jefferson County law enforcement, who notified the Office of the State Archaeologist. The remains were transferred to History Colorado in December 2011. They are identified as OAHP Case Number 283. The location from which the remains were removed is not known. Osteological analysis determined that the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The estimated antiquity is unknown. \n Sometime in 1987, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Park County, CO, although the exact location is unknown. In 1988, the human remains were transferred to Dr. Michael Charney, a former professor at Colorado State University. Dr. Charney\\'s analysis determined that they were not of forensic interest and that the remains are of Native American ancestry. He reported this to the Park County Coroner and retained the remains. In 1998, the remains were claimed as private property by the widow of Dr. Charney after his death. The human remains were subsequently taken into custody by the Larimer County Sheriff\\'s Office. Following litigation in 2006, the remains were inadvertently returned to Park County because the box they were in stated they were of forensic interest. In December 2011, the Park County Coroner discovered the error and transferred the remains to History Colorado, who had previously received a court order to repatriate all Native American human remains formerly in the possession of Dr. Charney, in accordance with Colorado State burial law and NAGPRA. They are identified as OAHP Case Number 284. Additional osteological analysis by History Colorado confirmed that the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The estimated antiquity is unknown. \n In August 2011, a private citizen reported a discovery of human remains representing, at minimum, one individual to the Clear Creek County coroner. They are identified as OAHP Case Number 285. They were found near the site of a house that had burned down in October 2010. The exact location of removal is unknown. The Office of the State Archaeologist was notified and the remains were transferred to History Colorado in December 2011. Osteological analysis determined that the remains are of Native American ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. The estimated antiquity is unknown. \n ", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Determinations Made by History Colorado \n Officials at History Colorado have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains described above and any present-day Indian tribe. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of four individuals of Native American ancestry. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the five objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near the individual human remains at the time of death or later as a part of the death rite ceremony. \n History Colorado has determined that the human remains are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cculturally unidentifiable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under NAGPRA, 43 CFR 10.9 (e)(6). In 2006, History Colorado, in partnership with the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs, Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah, conducted consultations with the tribes that have ancestral ties to the state of Colorado to develop the process for disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects originating from inadvertent discoveries on Colorado state and private lands. As a result of the consultation, a process was developed, titled Process for Consultation, Transfer, and Reburial of Culturally Unidentifiable Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects Originating From Inadvertent Discoveries on Colorado State and Private Lands, (2008), (unpublished, on file with the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation). \n OAHP 282 was recovered from Rio Blanco County, which is located in the Basin and Plateau Consultation Region, as established by the Process. Tribes with known aboriginal ties to this region and those who have asked to be notified of discoveries in the Basin and Plateau Consultation Region were invited to consult for OAHP 282. All tribes with ancestral ties to Colorado were invited to consult regarding OAHP 283-285, due to their vague provenience information. \n The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) is responsible for recommending specific actions for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains. On November 3-4, 2006, the Process was presented to the Review Committee for consideration. A January 8, 2007, letter on behalf of the Review Committee from the Designated Federal Officer transmitted the provisional authorization to proceed with the Process upon receipt of formal responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, subject to forthcoming conditions imposed by the Secretary of the Interior. On May 15-16, 2008, the responses from the Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico, and Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma were submitted to the Review Committee. On September 23, 2008, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, as the designee for the Secretary of the Interior, transmitted the authorization for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains according to the Process and NAGPRA, pending publication of a Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register. This notice fulfills that requirement. \n 43 CFR 10.11 was promulgated March 15, 2010, providing a process for the disposition of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains recovered from tribal or aboriginal lands as established by the final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or U.S. Court of Claims, a treaty, Act of Congress, or Executive Order, or other authoritative governmental sources. There is no evidence indicating that the human remains reported in this notice originated from tribal or aboriginal lands, making them eligible for disposition under the Process.\\n         \n ", "a_r_d": "Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Sheila Goff, NAGPRA Liaison, History Colorado, 1200 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203, telephone (303) 866-4531, before August 20, 2012.
