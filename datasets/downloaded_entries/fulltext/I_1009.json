The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        On May 16th and 17th, 2007, an initial assessment of the human remains was made by the ARP professional staff and the University of Colorado Natural History Museum, Boulder, CO, professional staff in consultation with representatives of the following tribes: Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma (foremerly the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma); Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of the Cheyenne River Reservation, South Dakota; Crow Tribe of Montana; Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Jicarilla Apache Nation, New Mexico; Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma; Southern Ute Indian Tribe of the Southern Ute Reservation, Colorado; Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota; Ute Indian Tribe of Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah; and the Ute Mountain Tribe of the Ute Mountain Reservation, Colorado, New Mexico & Utah.

The remains were discovered during the course of a watershed improvement project in the Gordon Creek drainage eroding out of a stream bank on a tributary of Gordon Creek within the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest. Excavation was conducted by the Department of Anthropology, University of Colorado, with the approval of the USDA, Forest Service. After the excavation concluded, the human remains and the associated funerary objects were sent to the University of Colorado Natural History Museum. No known individuals were identified. The 24 associated funerary objects are 1 stone tool core; 1 stone biface perform tool; 1 stone perform tool; 2 stone biface tool fragments; 7 stone tool flakes; 1 sample of ochre (hematite); 2 animal bones (large mammal hyoid bones with cut marks on the ends); 4 elk incisor teeth; 1 burnt animal bone; 1 soil sample from burial pit; 1 soil sample labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cattempted C14 sample\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; 1 carbonized sap specimen; and 1 lot of residue from C14 testing.\\n        Although the human remains were fragmentary, some of the skeleton and associated artifacts were removed from a slump below the burial pit and some of the skeleton was in situ, all of the skeletal remains were stained with a thick coat of red ocher. The remains were interred in a flexed position, in an intentionally formed burial pit. Subsequent analysis determined that the remains are those of a 25-30 year old American Indian (paleoindian) female and that the burial dates to approximately 9,000 year B.P.
