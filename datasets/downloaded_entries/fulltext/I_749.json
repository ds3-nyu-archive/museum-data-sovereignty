The site is located on farmland north of Imlay City and had been plowed over for years. Between 1923 and 1935, amateur archaeologist Carman Baggerly collected at the site with the landowner\\'s permission. Baggerly donated many of the human remains and objects to the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropological Archaeology (UMMAA) over that period. These donations prompted a UMMAA excavation of the site that occurred from July 19 to November 5, 1935, under the direction of Wilbert Hinsdale and Emerson Greenman.\\n        UMMAA\\'s excavation found 2 distinct structures at the site based on the presence of post molds. These structures were recorded as Enclosures 1 and 2. The structures were described as successively re-built longhouses standing parallel to one another with walls approximately 5-6 feet thick. All of the burials were found within or near Enclosure 1, which was only partially excavated. Archaeologists found hearths and pits filled with a mixture of ashes, charcoal, faunal bones, and tobacco pipe fragments above the burials throughout Enclosure 1. Excavations found 57 distinct burial features, with 16 additional site features having human remains. The individuals included both males and females, ages ranging from infants to older adults. No known individuals were identified. A variety of burial types were found at the site including extended burials, bundle burials, torso burials, and cremations. One burial was noted as containing red ochre. Many of the human remains found within Enclosure 1 show considerable evidence of post-mortem modifications. Post-mortem modifications included cutting, shaving and drilling of the ends of long bones; drilled perforations, smaller than 3cm diameter, at the top of crania and 1 manubrium; and plaque disc removals, larger than 3cm diameter, cut from either the top or back of crania. Some remains were noted as found rearticulated, with the modified heads of femora inserted into the obturator foramen of the pelvis. Between 1996 and 2006, 1 lot of DNA extractions was taken from human remains in this site collection.\\n        The human remains date to the Late Woodland Period (900-1300 A.D.) based on objects found at the site. The 812 associated funerary objects present are 789 ceramic sherds, 20 black bear bone fragments, 1 stone celt, 1 ceramic elbow pipe, and 1 lot of red ochre and soil.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of Michigan\\n        Officials of the University of Michigan have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice are Native American based on cranial morphology, dental traits, accession documentation, and archeological context.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 94 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 812 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 According to final judgments of the Indian Claims Commission, the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Treaties, Acts of Congress, and Executive Orders indicate that the land from which the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects were removed is the aboriginal land of The Tribes.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), the disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects may be to The Tribes.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects, should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Ben Secunda, NAGPRA Project Manager, University of Michigan Office of Research, 4080 Fleming Building, 503 S.
