These remains were donated to the Arizona State Museum by unknown persons in 1967. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are the jars in which the remains had been placed subsequent to cremation. \\n        Based on characteristics of the mortuary program, these burials have been identified as having a high probability of association with the Hohokam archeological tradition. \\n        In 1971, human remains representing three individuals were removed from surface contexts within the Gila River Indian Community, Pinal County, AZ, by Donald Wood, Arizona State Museum staff. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Based on characteristics of the mortuary program, these burials have been identified as having a high probability of association with the archeologically-defined Hohokam tradition. \\n        Continuities of ethnographic materials and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman), Pee Posh, and Puebloan cultures. Oral traditions documented for the Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; and the Pueblo of Zuni support affiliation with Hohokam sites in central Arizona. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Arizona State Museum and the Bureau of Indian Affairs have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of 179 individuals of Native American ancestry.
