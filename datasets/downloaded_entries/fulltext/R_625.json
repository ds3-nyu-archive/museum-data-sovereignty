The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        The cultural item consists of a memorial pole, approximately 20 feet in height, bearing the Brown bear crest known as Kaats\\xe2\\x80\\x99Eeti Gaas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (memorial pole of Kaats\\xe2\\x80\\x99). The crest depicts a man named Kaats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 who married a bear. The memorial pole was standing alongside the Xoots Hit (Brown Bear house) at Angoon, AK, in 1908. The memorial pole was removed from Angoon by unknown parties and, in 1914, was donated to the University of Northern Colorado by Andrew Thompson, United States Commissioner of Education in Alaska. The pole was adopted as the University of Northern Colorado\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cschool mascot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that same year.\\n        Consultation with representatives of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes indicates that at the time of its removal from Angoon, the memorial pole was considered the communal property of the Teikweidi of the Zooszidaa Kwaan, the Brown Bear clan of Angoon, AK, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the University of Northern Colorado have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(4), this cultural item has ongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the tribe itself, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual. Officials of the University of Northern Colorado also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between this cultural item and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indians Tribes, representing the Teikweidi of the Zooszidaa Kwaan.\\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indians Tribes. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this cultural item should contact Ronald J. Lambden, general counsel, University of Northern Colorado, Carter Hall-room 4000, Campus Box 59, Greeley, CO 80639, telephone (970) 351-2399, before October 11, 2002.
