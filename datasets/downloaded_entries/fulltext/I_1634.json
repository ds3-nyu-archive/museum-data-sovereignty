The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Slater Museum of Natural History, University of Puget Sound professional staff with help from a consultant in consultation with representatives of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe of the Muckleshoot Reservation, Washington; Nisqually Indian Tribe of the Nisqually Reservation, Washington; Puyallup Tribe of the Puyallup Reservation, Washington; Squaxin Island Tribe of the Squaxin Indian Reservation, Washington; and Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, Washington.\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the vicinity of Gig Harbor, Pierce County, WA, probably by Frank D\\'Andrea.
