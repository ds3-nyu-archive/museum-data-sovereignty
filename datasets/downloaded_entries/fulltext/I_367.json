The human remains were removed from a site in Queens County, Long Island, NY.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, professional staff in consultation with the Unkechaug Indian Nation and the Matinecock Tribe of Long Island, both of which are non-federally recognized Indian groups. The Shinnecock Indian Nation was invited to participate but was not involved in consultations.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown site in Long Island, Queens County, NY, and were subsequently donated to the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach. The Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, assumed jurisdiction over these human remains pursuant to Section 872.05, Florida Statutes. The human remains were determined to be from a Native American individual based on the labeling on the mandible stating \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMATINICACK INDIN LONG ISLAND.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Matinecock are a Native American group who are historically documented on Long Island and connected through kinship to the other Long Island Nations including the Unkechaug, Shinnecock, and Montaukett. Historical evidence suggests that the human remains may have come from a Matinecock cemetery that was removed in 1931 and 1932, when Northern Boulevard was widened in Queens Borough, Long Island, NY. The burials belonging to that cemetery were reportedly relocated to another cemetery. Descendants of people buried in the cemetery note that some of the human remains and items removed during the exhumations were not reburied. The Museum of Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach lacked accession records from many of its older collections. The spelling of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMatinicack Indin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the label of the mandible suggests that the human remains were collected by a non-professional archeologist or anthropologist who, on information or belief, determined that they were affiliated with the Matinecock. No other provenience information is available. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.16, the Secretary of the Interior may recommend transfer of control of culturally unidentifiable human remains. In September 2016, the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, requested that the Secretary, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee, recommend the proposed transfer of control of the culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains in this notice to the Unkechaug Indian Nation, a non-federally recognized Indian group. The Review Committee, acting pursuant to its responsibility under 25 U.S.C. 3006(c)(5), considered the request at its March 2017 meeting and recommended to the Secretary that the proposed transfer of control proceed.
