The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department contracted the excavations out to SPEARS, Inc., in West Fork, AR. The human remains were transferred to the Arkansas Archeological Survey (AAS) for curation in 2009. The human remains were identified as one adult (18-20 years) and female. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at site 3CT340 indicate these human remains were probably buried during the Transitional Late Woodland/Early Mississippian period (A.D. 700-1200).\\n        In 2004, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were recovered from the Gilmore North site (3CT341) in Crittenden County, AR, during Phase III mitigation for the improvements to Highway 63. The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department contracted the excavations out to SPEARS, Inc., in West Fork, AR. The human remains were transferred to the AAS for curation in 2009. The human remains were identified as two youths of unknown sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at site 3CT341 indicate these human remains were probably buried during the Transitional Late Woodland/Early Mississippian period (A.D. 700-1200).\\n        In 1968, 1969, and 1974, human remains representing, at minimum, 62 individuals were recovered from the Hazel site (3PO6), Poinsett County, AR. The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department planned to reroute State Highway 308 which went directly through the Hazel site. The excavations were undertaken by the AAS, and the human remains and associated funerary objects have remained at the AAS\\'s collections since the time of their removal. The human remains were identified as eight infants (less than two years old), 12 children (2 to 12 years), one youth (13 to 18 years), 34 adults (19 to 35 years), two old adults (over 35 years), and five undetermined. The human remains were further identified as eight female, 24 males, and 30 undetermined. No known individuals were identified. The 251 associated funerary objects are 59 whole or partial ceramic vessels, 2 ceramic discs, 1 large body sherd, 16 bone beads, 1 bone gorget, 3 bone awls, 1 deer humerus scraper, 1 antler dagger, 1 raccoon jaw, 1 beaver tooth, 14 conch shell beads, 89 disc-shaped shell beads, 40 pearl-slug shell beads, 7 barrel-shaped shell beads, 2 disc-shaped shell ear ornaments, 2 shell fragments, 1 shell mask gorget, 1 shell spoon, 1 conch shell pendant, 1 willow-leaf knife, 1 biface, 1 ball of red ocher, 1 disc-shaped stone, 1 piece of coarse sandstone, 1 triangular piece of sandstone, 1 cymbal-shaped copper disc, and 1 piece of unidentified chalky material. Diagnostic artifacts found at the Hazel site (3PO6) indicate that the human remains were probably buried during the Parkin Phase (A.D. 1300-1600).\\n        In 1984, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals (84-712, 84-712-1, Burials 1 and 2) were recovered from the Ink Bayou site (3PU252) in Pulaski County, AR. The Ink Bayou site was excavated to mitigate the impacts of construction of a bridge over Ink Bayou. The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department contracted the excavations out to the AAS, and the human remains have remained at the AAS\\'s collections since the time of their removal. The human remains consisted of three adults of unknown age, one male and two undetermined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. Diagnostic artifacts found at the Ink Bayou site (3PU252) indicate that these human remains were probably buried during the Plum Bayou Phase (A.D. 750-950).\\n        For the human remains listed in this notice, geographic affiliation is consistent with the historically documented territory of The Quapaw Tribe of Indians.
