The human remains were removed from Barrow, AK.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by UC, Davis professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1951, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Point Barrow in Barrow, AK. The human remains were collected by Henry Everett Childs, Jr., a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley at the time. In 2014, the human remains were identified in the collections of the UC Davis, Museum of Wildlife and Fish Biology and reported to the NAGPRA Project. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects were present.\\n        The human remains were collected during a biological field expedition. The human remains have been determined to be Native American based on antiquity, dental wear patterns, and historical and archeological information. Geographic, historical, archeological, and biological information suggest continuity between human remains from Point Barrow and contemporary Inupiat people that are present day members of the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government.\\n        The human remains described above lack precise context information. However, there are several known archeological sites in the Point Barrow area including Nuvuk (Nuwuk), Birnirk, Kugok, Utqia\\xc4\\xa1vik, and Walakpa that have been extensively excavated, and provide related information to assist with interpretation. Collectively the sites in the Point Barrow area represent Birnirk, Thule, Historical and Modern Inupiat archeological phases. Radiocarbon dates indicate an essentially continuous occupation of the Nuvuk site. Based on the state of preservation, the human remains described above date to the last 1000 years, but likely date to the late Prehistoric-early Historic period (1730s 1850s B.C.).\\n\\n        The historic village of Nuvuk was occupied at the time of Euroamerican contact (1826) and later abandoned. Some elders now living in Barrow were born and raised at Nuvuk. Recent ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis suggests some genetic continuity between Paleoeskimo (e.g., Arctic Small Tool tradition) and contemporary Inupiat people of the region. However, the Inupiat in the North Slope of Alaska have demonstrated cultural and genetic ties to their ancestral Thule and Birnirk cultures. Based on this information, the human remains described in this Notice are determined to be culturally affiliated with Inupiat of the Point Barrow area, represented today by the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government.\\n        Determinations Made by the University of California, Davis\\n        Officials at UC Davis have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Megon Noble, NAGPRA Project Manager, University of California, Davis, 433 Mrak Hall, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, telephone (530)752-8501, email mnoble@ucdavis.edu, by June 10, 2016.
