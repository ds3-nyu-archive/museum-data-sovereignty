The earliest collections listed on the NIC appear to be from Archaic contexts. Already during the Mississippi period (A.D. 950-1541), though, distinctive local groups emerge in the archeological record that correspond in geographical extent and cultural cohesiveness to present-day groups that include the Quapaw. \n This notice includes a variety of terms commonly used in discussions of Arkansas archeology and the historical trajectories that gave rise to specific Native American communities identified in the historical record. Based on the archeological context for these sites and what is presently known about the peoples who pre-date the historic Quapaw people and occupied the sites listed in this notice, the Arkansas Archeological Survey has determined the human remains listed in this notice are culturally affiliated with The Quapaw Tribe of Indians. \n Determinations Made by the Arkansas Archeological Survey \n Officials of the Arkansas Archeological Survey have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 104 individuals of Native American ancestry. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 13 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and The Quapaw Tribe of Indians. \n Additional Requestors and Disposition \n Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. George Sabo, Director, Arkansas Archeological Survey, 2475 North Hatch Avenue, Fayetteville, AR 72704, (479) 575-3556, gsabo@uark.edu, by March 1, 2018.

The earliest collections listed on the NIC appear to be from Archaic contexts. Already during the Mississippi period (A.D. 950-1541), though, distinctive local groups emerge in the archeological record that correspond in geographical extent and cultural cohesiveness to present-day groups that include the Quapaw. \n This notice includes a variety of terms commonly used in discussions of Arkansas archeology and the historical trajectories that gave rise to specific Native American communities identified in the historical record. Based on the archeological context for these sites and what is presently known about the peoples who pre-date the historic Quapaw people and occupied the sites listed in this notice, the Arkansas Archeological Survey has determined the human remains listed in this notice are culturally affiliated with The Quapaw Tribe of Indians. \n ", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Determinations Made by the Arkansas Archeological Survey \n Officials of the Arkansas Archeological Survey have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 104 individuals of Native American ancestry. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 13 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and The Quapaw Tribe of Indians. \n ", "a_r_d": "Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. George Sabo, Director, Arkansas Archeological Survey, 2475 North Hatch Avenue, Fayetteville, AR 72704, (479) 575-3556, gsabo@uark.edu, by March 1, 2018.
