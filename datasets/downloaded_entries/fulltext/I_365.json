Contract workers encountered human remains while excavating sand from private property near Interstate-75 in Bridgeport Township. After workers completed removing the sand, amateur archeologists Leo Purple and Arthur Graves conducted a salvage excavation at the site from late-winter through the fall of 1970. Purple had surface collected the site for several years prior to the excavation. Primary and secondary burials were noted at the site. The majority of the burials excavated were bundle burials, along with multiple objects. Purple and Graves divided the site collections, donating some to the UMMAA in 1976, and some to the Chippewa Nature Center (CNC) in Midland, MI, in 1974. In 2006, the CNC donated human remains and objects from the Bugai site to the UMMAA. The human remains collected from the site include 1 adult, over 35 years old, possibly male; 1 adult, age indeterminate, possibly female; 1 child, 7.5-12.5 years old; 1 adult, age and sex indeterminate; 1 adult, age and sex indeterminate; 1 child, 4-8 years old; 1 adult, over 30 years old, possibly male; 1 adolescent/young adult, 16-20 years old, possibly female; 1 adult, over 35 years old, male; 1 child, 2-4 years old; 1 adult, 23-44 years old, possibly male; 1 adult, over 30 years old, male; 1 adult, over 35-45 years old, female; 1 adult, over 40 years old, possibly female; 1 child, 3-5 years old; 1 adult, 35-45 years old, possibly female; 1 adult, age indeterminate, possibly male; 1 juvenile, age indeterminate; 1 child, 5-9 years old; and 1 child, 2-4 years old. One lot of DNA extractions, taken from human remains in this collection between 1996 and 2006, will also be included in this transfer. The human remains are believed to date to the Early Late Woodland Period (A.D. 500-1100) based on diagnostic artifacts associated with the burials and mortuary treatment.

Contract workers encountered human remains while excavating sand from private property near Interstate-75 in Bridgeport Township. After workers completed removing the sand, amateur archeologists Leo Purple and Arthur Graves conducted a salvage excavation at the site from late-winter through the fall of 1970. Purple had surface collected the site for several years prior to the excavation. Primary and secondary burials were noted at the site. The majority of the burials excavated were bundle burials, along with multiple objects. Purple and Graves divided the site collections, donating some to the UMMAA in 1976, and some to the Chippewa Nature Center (CNC) in Midland, MI, in 1974. In 2006, the CNC donated human remains and objects from the Bugai site to the UMMAA. The human remains collected from the site include 1 adult, over 35 years old, possibly male; 1 adult, age indeterminate, possibly female; 1 child, 7.5-12.5 years old; 1 adult, age and sex indeterminate; 1 adult, age and sex indeterminate; 1 child, 4-8 years old; 1 adult, over 30 years old, possibly male; 1 adolescent/young adult, 16-20 years old, possibly female; 1 adult, over 35 years old, male; 1 child, 2-4 years old; 1 adult, 23-44 years old, possibly male; 1 adult, over 30 years old, male; 1 adult, over 35-45 years old, female; 1 adult, over 40 years old, possibly female; 1 child, 3-5 years old; 1 adult, 35-45 years old, possibly female; 1 adult, age indeterminate, possibly male; 1 juvenile, age indeterminate; 1 child, 5-9 years old; and 1 child, 2-4 years old. One lot of DNA extractions, taken from human remains in this collection between 1996 and 2006, will also be included in this transfer.
