Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA. The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Fresno County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice. \\n        An assessment of the human remains, and catalog records and associated documents relevant to the human remains, was made by Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of Big Sandy Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Cold Springs Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California (also known as Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi Yokut Tribe, California); Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California.\\n        In 1948, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from site CA-Fre-27, Fresno County, CA, by F. Fenenga and F.A. Riddell, University of California Archaeological Survey, and transferred to the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology the same year.  No known individual was identified. The four associated funerary objects are one abalone shell, one steatite ornament, and two pottery fragments.\\n        Site CA-Fre-27 is a habitation site located on the east bank of the Kings River within the current impoundment boundaries of the Pine Flat Reservoir. Characteristics of material culture, including steatite beads, brownware ceramics, and historic glass trade beads, indicate that the site was inhabited post-A.D. 1500.\\n\\n        Officials of the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, and Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of at least one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, and Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the four objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.  Lastly, officials of the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, and Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Big Sandy Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Cold Springs Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California (also known as Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi Yokut Tribe, California); Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact C. Richard Hitchcock, NAGPRA Coordinator, Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, telephone (510) 642-6096, before February 7, 2005.
