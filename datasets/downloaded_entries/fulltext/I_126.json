No known individuals were identified. The 1,234 associated funerary objects are one chipped stone biface fragment, 11 chipped stone cobble fragments, 556 chipped stone flakes, two chipped stone projectile point fragments, one large chipped stone projectile point, three pottery sherds, 51 shell fragments, six bird bone beads, 72 burned faunal bone fragments, 487 unmodified faunal bone fragments, and 44 charcoal and burned nutshell fragments.\\n        The Converse 2 site is Plains Woodland in age (300 B.C.-A.D. 1000).
