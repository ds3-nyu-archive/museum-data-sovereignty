The recovered collections were transferred to three separate repositories: The Smithsonian Institution; the University of Washington (UW) Burke Museum, Seattle, WA; and UO-MNCH, Eugene, OR. The portion of the collections in the physical custody of UO-MNCH was re-inventoried in 1996, under a contract with the Corps.

The 1947 SRBS collection was transported to Fort Vancouver National Monument in Vancouver, WA. In 1960, a portion of the collection was transferred to and accessioned by UO-MNCH (OSMA accession #102). The unassociated funerary objects were described as originating from the backdirt piles of one or more disturbed burials identified at the site. The ten unassociated funerary objects are 1 copper pendant, 3 metal fragments, and 6 glass beads. The site consisted of a village and burial site dating to the late pre-contact protohistoric period or earlier.\\n        In 1947, SRBS removed funerary objects from burials at 45FR28, on Borgan\\'s Island, in Benton County, WA. At the time, 45FR28 was reported to contain extensively disturbed burials marked by cedar posts and located in the sand dunes on the southern end of the island. It is unclear whether or not human remains were collected during this survey. Materials from the 1947 SRBS investigations were transported to Fort Vancouver National Monument, in Vancouver, WA. In 1960, the collection was transferred to UO-MCNH (OSMA accession #202). Funerary objects were reportedly removed from Burials 1 and 2. The 14 unassociated funerary objects are 1 lot of clamshell disk beads, 1 lot of plant seed beads, 2 lots of Olivella shell beads, 1 lot of dentalium shells, 1 individual dentalium, 4 copper fragments, 1 projectile point fragment, 1 lot of hair, 1 lot of hair and fiber, and 1 iron spike. The site consisted of burials of the proto-historic to historic period date. The burial methods and artifacts are consistent with Plateau funerary practices during that era.\\n        Prior to 1950 or 1951, funerary objects were recovered on an island north of Hover, Benton County, WA, in direct association with a burial. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIsland North of Hover\\xe2\\x80\\x9d funerary objects were donated by a private party to the UO-MNCH in 1950 or 1951. No human remains were donated. The collection was re-inventoried by UO-MNCH in 1996, under a contract with the Corps. The 57 unassociated funerary objects are 23 decorated bird bones, 1 decorated animal bone, 4 grooved bones, 1 slotted bone, 2 projectile points, 1 pipe, 5 shell beads, 2 stone beads, 4 shell pendants, 2 jasper pendants, 3 stone pendants, 1 graphite pendant, 1 needle or awl, 5 elk incisors, 1 badger claw, and 1 carnivore claw.\\n        Determinations Made by the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District\\n        Officials of the U.S. Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Five lines of evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x94geographical, ethnographic, archeological, anthropological and historical\\xe2\\x80\\x94support a cultural affiliation between the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Oregon; Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation, Oregon; and the Nez Perce Tribe, Idaho (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and the unassociated funerary objects identified above.

Additionally, a cultural relationship is determined to exist between the sites and collections and the Wanapum Band, a non-Federally recognized Indian Group (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Indian Group\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 270 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from the specific burial sites of Native American individuals. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects, The Tribes and The Indian Group. Information provided by The Tribes and The Indian Group shows that they are descended from the Native people who occupied these sites, and that the individuals buried along the Snake and mid-Columbia Rivers are their ancestors.
