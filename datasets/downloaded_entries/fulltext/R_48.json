The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        In the late nineteenth century, three cultural items were removed from the Brewerton cemetery site in Onondaga County, NY. They were part a larger collection purchased by the museum from Otis M. Bigelow in 1914. The unassociated funerary objects are 3 pottery smoking pipes, including one with a side-facing bear effigy on the bowl (#31868), one with a ringed collar bowl (#31908), and one with a self-directed eagle effigy on the bowl (#31909). The pipes were illustrated by Rev. William M. Beauchamp in the late 19th century and described as being from a Native American grave. Based on the style of the pipes and other items reportedly found in the burial, and which are not in the museum\\'s possession, the cultural items probably date to the mid- to late-seventeenth century.\\n        In the late nineteenth century, four cultural items were removed from a site in the town of Pompey in Onondaga County, NY. The unassociated funerary objects are 2 rolled sheet brass tinklers, 1 brass wire hoop, and 1 black glass button (#50096). The cultural items were part of a larger collection belonging to Rev. William M. Beauchamp and purchased by the museum in 1949 from his daughter, Mrs. Grace B. Lodder. Beauchamp identified the cultural items as from a grave in Pompey. Beauchamp described the Pompey area as the early home of the Onondaga, where numerous village sites date from the late pre-contact period through the seventeenth century. Traded by the Dutch, similar glass buttons have been found on early historic Onondaga sites, and probably date to the 17th century.\\n        In 1908, 506 cultural items were removed from a site near Dorwin Springs, Onondaga Valley, in Onondaga County, NY. The 506 unassociated funerary objects are a string of 26 shell beads and 480 white glass seed beads (#50097). The cultural items were part of a larger collection belonging to Rev. William M. Beauchamp and purchased by the museum in 1949 from his daughter, Mrs. Grace B. Lodder. Beauchamp identified the burial as Native American and suggested the glass beads may have been part of a belt. He estimated the site dated to about A.D. 1750, a date consistent with the type of beads and other items reportedly found in the burial, and which are not in the museum\\'s possession.\\n        Determinations Made by the New York State Museum\\n        Officials of the New York State Museum have determined that:\\n        \\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the 513 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of a Native American individual.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Onondaga Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Lisa Anderson, New York State Museum, 3049 Cultural Education Center, Albany, NY 12230, telephone (518) 486-2020, email lisa.anderson@nysed.gov, by May 14, 2018.
