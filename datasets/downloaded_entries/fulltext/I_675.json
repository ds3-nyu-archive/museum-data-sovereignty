The human remains were removed from sites within the boundaries of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Gila and Navajo Counties, AZ.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the ASM professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Arizona; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1987, fragmentary human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from the Hilltop Ruin Site, AZ P:14:12(ASM) in Navajo County, AZ, during a legally-authorized survey conducted by the University of Arizona Archaeological Field School. The human remains were collected by field school staff during survey of several sites that had been subjected to vandalism. The human remains were brought to the University of Arizona at the conclusion of the field school, but were not accessioned at that time. The human remains were rediscovered by Arizona State Museum curators in 2014. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The Hilltop Ruin is a pueblo site of 75 to 100 rooms. The ceramic types indicate that the village was occupied during the period A.D. 1300 to 1400. These characteristics are consistent with the archeologically described Upland Mogollon or prehistoric Western Pueblo traditions.\\n\\n        In 1987, fragmentary human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from an unnamed site, AZ V:2:22(ASM) in Navajo County, AZ, during a legally-authorized survey conducted by the University of Arizona Archaeological Field School. The human remains were collected by field school staff during survey of several sites that had been subjected to vandalism. The human remains were brought to the University of Arizona at the conclusion of the field school, but were not accessioned at that time. The human remains were rediscovered by Arizona State Museum curators in 2014. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        AZ V:2:22(ASM) is described as a small pueblo site with a large quantity of surface pottery fragments and possibly including garden plots. Based on the ceramic assemblage, the site likely dates to the late Mogollon period. These characteristics are consistent with the archeologically described Upland Mogollon or prehistoric Western Pueblo traditions.\\n        In 1987, fragmentary human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from Canyon Butte Pueblo, AZ V:2:49(ASM) in Gila County, AZ, during a legally-authorized survey conducted by the University of Arizona Archaeological Field School. The human remains were collected by field school staff during survey of several sites that had been subjected to vandalism. The human remains were brought to the University of Arizona at the conclusion of the field school, but were not accessioned at that time. The human remains were rediscovered by Arizona State Museum curators in 2014. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Canyon Butte Pueblo is an L-shaped masonry building of 40 to 65 rooms, with a walled plaza. The architectural forms and ceramic types indicate that the village was occupied during the period A.D. 1275-1400. These characteristics are consistent with the archeologically described Upland Mogollon or prehistoric Western Pueblo traditions.\\n        A detailed discussion of the basis for cultural affiliation of archeological sites in the region where the above sites are located may be found in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCultural Affiliation Assessment of White Mountain Apache Tribal Lands (Fort Apache Indian Reservation),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by John R. Welch and T.J. Ferguson (2005). To summarize, archeologists have used the terms Upland Mogollon or prehistoric Western Pueblo to define the archeological complexes represented by the sites listed above. Material culture characteristics of these traditions include a temporal progression from earlier pit houses to later masonry pueblos, villages organized in room blocks of contiguous dwellings associated with plazas, rectangular kivas, polished and paint-decorated ceramics, unpainted corrugated ceramics, inhumation burials, cradleboard cranial deformation, grooved stone axes, and bone artifacts. The combination of the material culture attributes and a subsistence pattern, which included hunting and gathering augmented by maize agriculture, helps to identify an earlier group. Archeologists have also remarked that there are strong similarities between this earlier group and present-day tribes included in the Western Pueblo ethnographic group, especially the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico. The similarities in ceramic traditions, burial practices, architectural forms, and settlement patterns have led archeologists to believe that the prehistoric inhabitants of the Mogollon Rim region migrated north and west to the Hopi mesas, and north and east to the Zuni River Valley. Certain objects found in Upland Mogollon archeological sites have been found to have strong resemblances to ritual paraphernalia that are used in continuing religious practices by the Hopi and Zuni. Some petroglyphs on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation have also persuaded archeologists of continuities between the earlier identified group and current-day Western Pueblo people. Biological information from the site of Grasshopper Pueblo, which is located in close proximity to the sites listed above, supports the view that the prehistoric occupants of the Upland Mogollon region had migrated from various locations to the north and west of the region.\\n        Hopi and Zuni oral traditions parallel the archeological evidence for migration. Migration figures prominently in Hopi oral tradition, which refers to the ancient sites, pottery, stone tools, petroglyphs, and other artifacts left behind by the ancestors as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHopi Footprints.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This migration history is complex and detailed, and includes traditions relating specific clans to the Mogollon region. Hopi cultural advisors have also identified medicinal and culinary plants at archeological sites in the region. Their knowledge about these plants was passed down to them from the ancestors who inhabited these ancient sites. Migration is also an important attribute of Zuni oral tradition, and includes accounts of Zuni ancestors passing through the Upland Mogollon region. The ancient villages mark the routes of these migrations. Zuni cultural advisors remark that the ancient sites were not abandoned. People returned to these places from time to time, either to reoccupy them or for the purpose of religious pilgrimages\\xe2\\x80\\x94a practice that has continued to the present-day. Archeologists have found ceramic evidence at shrines in the Upland Mogollon region that confirms these reports. Zuni cultural advisors have names for plants endemic to the Mogollon region that do not grow on the Zuni Reservation. They also have knowledge about traditional medicinal and ceremonial uses for these resources, which has been passed down to them from their ancestors. Furthermore, Hopi and Zuni cultural advisors have recognized that their ancestors may have been co-resident at some of the sites in this region during their ancestral migrations.\\n        There are differing points of view regarding the possible presence of Apache people in the Upland Mogollon region during the time that these ancient sites were occupied. Some Apache traditions describe interactions with Ancestral Puebloan people during this time, but according to these stories, Puebloan people and Apache people were regarded as having separate identities. The White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona, does not claim cultural affiliation with the human remains from these ancestral Upland Mogollon sites. As reported by Welch and Ferguson (2005), consultations between the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona, and the Navajo Nation, Arizona, New Mexico & Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; and Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico, have indicated that none of these tribes wish to pursue claims of affiliation with sites on White Mountain Apache Tribal lands. Finally, the White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona, supports the repatriation of human remains from these ancestral Upland Mogollon sites and is ready to assist the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, in their reburial.\\n        Determinations Made by the Arizona State Museum\\n        Officials of the Arizona State Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 6 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to John McClelland, NAGPRA Coordinator, Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, telephone (520) 626-2950, by May 28, 2015.
