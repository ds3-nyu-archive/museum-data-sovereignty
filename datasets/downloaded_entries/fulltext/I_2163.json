The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology professional staff and a contract physical anthropologist, in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; Chickasaw Nation, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma. \\n        At an unknown date, human remains representing two individuals were removed from ancient mounds in Alabama. At an unknown date between the 1920\\'s and the 1950\\'s, the two sets of remains were acquired by the University of Denver Museum of Anthropology. One set of remains is listed as coming from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlabama Mound 1,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the other set of remains is listed as coming from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlabama Mound 2.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mounds generally were constructed by ancient Native Americans in Alabama beginning circa 100 B.C. and continuing to circa A.D. 1600. After that date, individual Native Americans may have been buried in old mounds throughout the 19th century. There is no other information on the provenience, age, or cultural context of the remains, or the circumstances under which these remains were recovered. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Alabama has been identified as the ancestral land of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; Chickasaw Nation, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma. This association is supported by oral historical, archaeological, ethnological, historical, and geographical evidence. \\n\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of two individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the University of Denver Department of Anthropology and Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; Chickasaw Nation, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas; Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma; Chickasaw Nation, Oklahoma; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, Louisiana; Kialegee Tribal Town, Oklahoma; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mississippi; Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Oklahoma; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma.
