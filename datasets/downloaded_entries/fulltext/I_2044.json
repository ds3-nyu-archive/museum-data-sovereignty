The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Kaw Nation, Oklahoma. \\n        In 1868, human remains representing one individual were sent to the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology by U.S. Army Surgeon B. E. Fryer of Fort Harker, KS. The individual was wounded in 1867 near Fort Zara, Barton County, KS, and later died at Fort Harker. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Based on accession records of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the individual has been determined to be Native American. Accession records also indicate that the individual was a Kaw male who was wounded in a fight with the Cheyenne, and died 20 days later. Biological evidence of the individual\\'s injury is consistent with the accession file information. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Officials of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Kaw Nation, Oklahoma. \\n        This notice has been sent to officials of the Kaw Nation, Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Lenore Barbian, Ph.D., Assistant Curator, Anatomical Collections, National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Building 54, Washington, DC 20306-6000, telephone (202) 782-2203, before June 4, 2001.
