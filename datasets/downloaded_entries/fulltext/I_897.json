The Clinton County Sheriff\\'s Department collected the remains of one adult male from a location in Essex Township, MI, and sent them to the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology (UMMA) for identification. The human remains were identified as Native American and donated to the UMMA on October 16, 1954. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1951, human remains representing, at minimum, 1 individual were removed from the Virgil Olson site (20CL30) in Clinton County, MI. The remains of one adult were found during gravel pit operations on private land, and the Clinton County Sheriff\\'s Department was contacted to investigate. The Sherriff\\'s Department determined the human remains were Native American and donated them to the UMMA. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date in the 1920s, human remains representing, at minimum, 1 individual were removed from the Gladwin site in Gladwin County, MI. The remains of an adult female were removed from a mound near Gladwin, MI, and donated to the UMMA. No date or time period for the human remains could be established. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        On an unknown date prior to 1924, human remains representing, at minimum, 2 individuals were removed from the St. Louis site in Gratiot County, MI.

A local resident reportedly found the remains of eight individuals in a mound located near the Montcalm and Gratiot County line. Only one cranium and one mandible were donated to the UMMA. The remains are from two individuals. The cranium is from a middle-aged adult male and the mandible is from a younger adult male. The cranium has an irregular-cut hole on the left parietal made post-mortem, but the cut hole differs from the type of post-mortem cutting typically associated with the practice of plaque removal. It was reported that all of the crania found in the mound showed evidence of post-mortem drilling. The human remains date to the Late Woodland Period based on mortuary treatment.
