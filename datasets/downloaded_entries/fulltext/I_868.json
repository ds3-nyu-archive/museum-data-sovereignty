No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are ceramic sherds.\\n\\n        The remains were recovered during the initial testing of prehistoric sites with Native American cultural contexts in the Millwood Reservoir area and are likely from a prehistoric site in the area. Based on the physical preservation of the remains and the likely Native American prehistoric archeological context, the human remains are determined to be of Native American ancestry. Archeological evidence from sites in the region date to the late prehistoric period, from 900-1500 A.D.\\n        Five lines of evidence support a cultural affiliation finding for the site including geographical, archeological, anthropological, historical, and oral history information gathered during consultation. The Caddo have a long association with the territory in which they were first encountered by the Europeans including in southwestern Arkansas. The emergence of the Caddo culture in the region of southwestern Arkansas, northern Louisiana, southeastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas is documented by 900 A.D. or shortly thereafter. The distinctive ceramics and specific artifacts made of stone, bone, antler, and marine shell form a line of evidence archeologically connecting historic Caddo groups with this region. Historic records and ethnographic accounts place the Caddo in this region in the 1600s. Based on the cultural material, geographic location, dates of occupation, 18th and 19th century accounts of the occupants of the area, and information gained during consultation, Little Rock District has determined that the human remains and associated funerary objects from the sites listed in this notice are culturally affiliated with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Determinations Made by the Little Rock District\\n        Officials of the Little Rock District have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 88 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 152 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Mr. Rodney Parker, District Archaeologist, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District, P.O.

Archeological evidence indicates a late prehistoric period occupation of the site from 900-1500 A.D. \n In the late 1950\\'s, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from an unknown site on the Millwood Reservoir, in Howard, Little River, or Sevier Counties, AR. The burials were excavated during legally authorized excavations by the University of Arkansas, and the human remains and associated funerary objects have been housed at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, since their excavation. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are ceramic sherds. \n The remains were recovered during the initial testing of prehistoric sites with Native American cultural contexts in the Millwood Reservoir area and are likely from a prehistoric site in the area. Based on the physical preservation of the remains and the likely Native American prehistoric archeological context, the human remains are determined to be of Native American ancestry. Archeological evidence from sites in the region date to the late prehistoric period, from 900-1500 A.D. \n Five lines of evidence support a cultural affiliation finding for the site including geographical, archeological, anthropological, historical, and oral history information gathered during consultation. The Caddo have a long association with the territory in which they were first encountered by the Europeans including in southwestern Arkansas. The emergence of the Caddo culture in the region of southwestern Arkansas, northern Louisiana, southeastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas is documented by 900 A.D. or shortly thereafter. The distinctive ceramics and specific artifacts made of stone, bone, antler, and marine shell form a line of evidence archeologically connecting historic Caddo groups with this region. Historic records and ethnographic accounts place the Caddo in this region in the 1600s. Based on the cultural material, geographic location, dates of occupation, 18th and 19th century accounts of the occupants of the area, and information gained during consultation, Little Rock District has determined that the human remains and associated funerary objects from the sites listed in this notice are culturally affiliated with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. \n ", "h_d_ci": "Null", "determinations": "Determinations Made by the Little Rock District \n Officials of the Little Rock District have determined that: \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 88 individuals of Native American ancestry. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 152 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. \n \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. \n ", "a_r_d": "Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Mr. Rodney Parker, District Archaeologist, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District, P.O.
