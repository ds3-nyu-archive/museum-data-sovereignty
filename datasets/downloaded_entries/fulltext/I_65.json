The human remains were excavated from the mounds by the acting curator of the Genesee County Historical Society and a group of volunteers, and were added to the collection of that organization. In 1966, upon the opening of the Sloan Museum, ownership of the collection of the Genesee County Historical Society was transferred to the Sloan Museum. Much of the human remains are too fragmentary to define age or sex; however, it was determined that among the nine individuals, there are four children and two adults, of whom two are male and two are probably female. No known individuals were identified. The human remains were not dated at the time of the analysis, and there are no cultural artifacts that would aid in determining the date of the human remains.
