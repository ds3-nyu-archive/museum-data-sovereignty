Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA. \\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 43 CFR 10.2 (c). The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice. \\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota. \\n        Prior to 1904, human remains representing at least six individuals (Cat. 12-36\\xe2\\x80\\x9412-41) were purchased from the Fred Harvey Company and donated to the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology by Phoebe A. Hearst in 1904. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present. \\n        Based on museum documentation, these individuals have been identified as Mandan from North Dakota. There is no existing information to contradict the museum documentation. \\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of six individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology also have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota. This notice has been sent to officials of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact C. Richard Hitchcock, Interim NAGPRA Coordinator, Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, telephone (510) 643-7884, before July 5, 2001. Repatriation of the human remains to the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. \\n        \\n          Dated: May 11, 2001. \\n          John Robbins, \\n          Assistant Director, Cultural Resources Stewardship and Partnerships. \\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc. 01-14070 Filed 6-4-01; 8:45 am] \\n      BILLING CODE 4310-70-F\\n    ", "agency1": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ", "sub_agency1": "National Park Service ", "dep_doc": "Null", "subject": "Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Phoebe A.
