The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from Doniphan County, KS.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The human remains are part of a larger collection donated to the Wyandotte County Historical Society and Museum by a local collector. In May 2015, the Kansas State Historical Society agreed to take these materials for the purpose of carrying out the requirements of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Staff identified and took possession of human remains: One left tibia, one right tibia, one left femur, one right femur, one immature right radius, one left fibula diaphysis, one unidentified long bone fragment, one primary lower incisor, one secondary upper right canine, one secondary dentition tooth with significant wear, with each of these three teeth probably representing a different individual; one right side of a mandible with teeth, one right fourth metatarsal, left and right tali and naviculars, one each; one right calcaneus, one each second and third cuneiforms (19 elements/teeth). The 7 associated funerary objects identified from the 14DP1 collection are one diaphysis of an animal humerus, possibly belonging to a badger; five middle phalanges belonging to an unidentified species; and one proximal epiphyseal plate of a phalanx belonging to an unidentified species.\\n        The site is affiliated with the Oneota archeological manifestation (A.D. 1000 to 1600), which is believed to be ancestral to the Kaw, the Otoe, or the Iowa. Several archeological sites in Kansas and Nebraska have been identified as Oneota (Ritterbush 2006:151). The Fanning site is tied both to the Oneota tradition and the historic Kansa (Buffalohead 2004:334-335; Marshall 2006:219, 230-231; 2008:87-92; O\\'Shea and Ludwickson 1992:16-17; Ritterbush 2006:151-152; Ritterbush and Logan 2009; Unrau 1971:19, Wedel 1959: 29, 51).\\n        Determinations Made by the Kansas State Historical Society\\n        Officials of the Kansas State Historical Society have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the seven objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Kaw Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Robert J.
