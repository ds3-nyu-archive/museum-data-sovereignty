The site was used as a burial ground for certain groups of the Central Sierra Miwok as late as the early twentieth century.

At that time, a number of cultural items were collected from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbackdirt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d left over from looting activities. Human remains were noted in direct association with these cultural items, although no human remains were collected. The 45 unassociated funerary objects are 1 whole abalone shell, 6 abalone pendants, 14 whole Olivella shells (5 are drilled), 9 Olivella spire-lopped shell beads, 5 clam shell disk beads, 9 glass trade beads (4 simple white beads, 2 compound white beads, and 3 red-on-black Cornaline d\\'Allepo beads), and 1 metal button with a glass acorn decoration.\\n        After consultation with the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria of California and Calaveras Band of Miwuk Indians, a non-federally recognized Indian group, a lineal descendant of the individual buried at the site, Dora Mata, was identified.
