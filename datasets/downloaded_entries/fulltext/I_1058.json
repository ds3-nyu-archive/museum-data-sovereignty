The human remains were removed from the Sacramento River Basin, Butte County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Fowler Museum at UCLA professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California and the Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria, California, and with the Cultural Preservation Committee of Koyomi\\'Kawi (Konkow) Maidu Tribe (a non-Federally recognized Indian group).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        In the summer of 1967, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from the Finch Site (CA-BUT-12), in the Sacramento River Basin, Butte County, CA. The remains were excavated during a UCLA field school conducted under the direction of Joseph Chartkoff. The human remains consist of three molars representing no more than three separate individuals. The degree of wear and root development on the teeth suggest that two of these individuals were juveniles, and one was likely an adult. The sex of the individuals cannot be determined. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Osteological and archaeological analyses have determined that the teeth are likely of Native American origin. Everett Smith, an elder, J.D. Smith, Chair of the Cultural Preservation Committee, and Arlene Ward, Mechoopda Maidu Tribe, have identified the recovery site as within the traditional territory of the Northwestern Maidu. The geographic location is consistent with the historically documented Konkow or Northwestern Maidu territory. Butte County, CA, is in the Central Valley region of traditional lands of the Maidu. Descendants of the Konkow or Northwestern Maidu were dispersed and became members of the Federally recognized tribes of the Berry Creek Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; Enterprise Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria, California; Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; and the Round Valley Indian Tribes of Round Valley Reservation, California. Multiple lines of evidence, including treaties, Acts of Congress, and Executive Orders, indicate that the land from which the human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Berry Creek Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; Enterprise Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria, California; Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; and the Round Valley Indian Tribes of Round Valley Reservation, California. A claim of repatriation has been received from the Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria, California.\\n        Determinations Made by the Fowler Museum at UCLA\\n        Officials of the Fowler Museum at UCLA have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9)-(10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of three individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Berry Creek Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; Enterprise Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria, California; Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California; and the Round Valley Indian Tribes of Round Valley Reservation, California.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains should contact Wendy G.
