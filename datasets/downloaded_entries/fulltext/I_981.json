The human remains were removed from Florida, most likely Brevard or Indian River counties.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the NAGPRA Coordinator and museum staff of the Beneski Museum of Natural History, Amherst College, and their agents, in consultation with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma; Catawba Indian Nation (aka Catawba Tribe of South Carolina); Cherokee Nation; Chickasaw Nation; Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana; Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; Jena Band of Choctaw Indians; Miccosukee Tribe of Indians; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians; Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma; Quapaw Tribe of Indians; Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Osage Nation (previously listed as the Osage Tribe); The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma; and the Wyandotte Nation (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Representatives of the Beneski Museum also contacted and attempted to consult with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); and the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In about 1925, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from either the area of Melbourne, in Brevard County, FL, or the area of Vero Beach, in Indian River County, FL, by F.B. Loomis, Professor of Geology at Amherst College. In the early 1980s, other remains collected at the same time were transferred from Amherst College to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Anthropology for permanent curation. These remains are the subject of a separate Notice of Inventory Completion.\\n        Museum records regarding these human remains are fragmentary and only indirectly constrain their provenience. The skull of one individual is marked with a number that corresponds to an entry in the ledger entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCatalogue of Skeletal Material, Gilbert Museum of Indian Relics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGilbert Museum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an old, informal name for the Gilbert Collection, which is presently housed in the Beneski Museum of Natural History, Amherst College. In its entirety, that entry reads: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeminole from Melbourne Florida. Complete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No known individuals have been identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Both individuals are marked with numbers that resemble the numbering system used by F.B. Loomis in the field.

No field notes from Loomis\\'s excavations remain, but newspaper reports at the time indicate Loomis collected from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburial mounds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Melbourne Florida Times, December 5, 1923).

No doubt, this conclusion derived from an interview with Loomis himself. Similarly, the Globe reported, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he skeletons lay in formation around the mound, and when one layer was completed, earth was piled on and another layer begun.
