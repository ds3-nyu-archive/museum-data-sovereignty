The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Tonto National Forest prior to 1972.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the San Diego Museum of Man professional staff (as the agent of the USDA Tonto National Forest) in consultation with representatives of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona; and the Zuni Tribe of the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Sometime prior to 1972, the cremated skeletal remains of at least one individual were discovered in a cremation pot at an archeological site in the Tonto Basin, AZ, on land under the jurisdiction of the Tonto National Forest. The human remains and the associated funerary object were collected by Mr. Thomas W. Sefton, and donated to the San Diego Museum of Man on December 8, 2003. No known individuals were identified. The associated funerary object is a cremation pot.\\n        According to the Museum of Man records, the human remains and associated funerary object are believed to date to approximately 1100 A.D. The cremated bones appear to have been placed in the pot after the cremation, and then both the bones and pot were re-fired. Much of the design of the pot was lost during this process.\\n        The human remains and the pot containing them have been determined by the Tonto National Forest to belong to the Hohokam archeological culture. The USDA Forest Service has determined that the cultural affiliation of cultural items associated with or reasonably related to the Hohokam, Salado, or Payson archeological traditions as they are identified on the Tonto National Forest lies with the modern O\\'odham people, represented by the Four Southern Tribes of Arizona: The Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona (GRIC); Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona (SRPMIC); and the Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.
