Moorehead. The human remains represent two adults and one subadult. The adults were reported under numbers A4345/2730, 2731, 2732, 2733, 2738 and 2739. The subadult was reported under number A4345/2735. No known individuals were identified. The three associated funerary objects are a non-diagnostic broken flint projectile point (A4345/2764); a prehistoric projectile point (A4345/2755); and a silver pendant (A14/42), collected by Mr. Marshall Anderson and purchased by the museum in the 1890s.\\n        At the time of removal, the remains were identified as possibly Shawnee. The location of removal, near Shawneetown, supports this identification. The prehistoric projectile point associated with the remains calls this identification into question, but it is possible the object was collected and retained by an historic Shawnee individual.
