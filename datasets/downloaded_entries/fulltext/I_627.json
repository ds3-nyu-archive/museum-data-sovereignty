The human remains were removed from Crosby, Mitchell, and Nolan Counties, TX.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin (TARL) professional staff, in consultation with representatives of the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma; Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; and the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1930, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual, were believed to be removed from site 41MH18, in Mitchell County, TX. Cyrus Ray and W.J. Van London visited an historic Native American burial previously found by Mr. Van London. The burial had apparently been disturbed before the joint visit. In a small, poorly documented collection, presumably made at the time of the visit, there are two extensively worn teeth, assumed to be from a single individual. No documentation exists concerning the transfer of these human remains to TARL. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Diagnostic artifacts date the site to the mid-1800s. The location of the site is within the territory inhabited by both the Comanche and Kiowa Indians during the 1800s.\\n        In 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed by a University of Texas archeologist from the Church Peak site (41NL8), in Nolan County, TX. This site was originally documented by E.B. Sayles. Although Mr. Sayles had collected some materials from the site, none can be specifically linked to these interments. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The mode of interment and diagnostic artifacts found at the site date the site to the mid-1800s. The location of the site is within the territory inhabited by both the Comanche and Kiowa Indians during the 1800s.\\n        In 1995, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were transferred to TARL from Midwestern State University (MSU). The human remains are represented by one cranium. The human remains had been found on an unspecified date during construction of a road and were given to Walter Dalquest at MSU. Some of the long bones and about 25 copper bracelets had also been given to Dr. Dalquest, but by the time of the transfer to TARL they had been lost. The human remains came from an unspecified locality, apparently private land, several miles north of Crosbyton, in Crosby County, TX. No other details of the site are known. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        The preservation of the human remains and the recorded presence of copper wire bracelets date the site to the late 1800s.
