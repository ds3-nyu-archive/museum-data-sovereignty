Officials of the Fowler Museum of Cultural History have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these \\nitems and the Hopi Tribe.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Hopi Tribe. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these objects should contact Dr. Diana \\nWilson, c/o NAGPRA Coordinator, Office of the Vice Chancellor, \\nResearch, Box 951405, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1405; telephone (310) 836-\\n4343 before December 28, 1998.
