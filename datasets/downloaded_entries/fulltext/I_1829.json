The Federal agency identified the cultural items and the cultural affiliation of the cultural items in consultation with museum officials and representatives of the Big Sandy Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Cold Springs Rancheria of Mono Indians of California; Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California; Santa Rosa Indian Community of the Santa Rosa Rancheria, California (also known as Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi Yokut Tribe, California); Table Mountain Rancheria of California; Tinoqui-Chalola Council of Kitanemuk and Yowlumne Tejon Indians (a nonfederally recognized Indian group); Tule River Indian Tribe of the Tule River Reservation, California; and Wukchumni Tribe of Yokut Indians (a nonfederally recognized Indian group).\\n        \\n          Information about cultural items.  In 1958, David Pendergast and Clement Meighan of the University of California, Los Angeles, under joint contract with the National Park Service, removed human remains representing a minimum of six individuals from the Greasy Creek site (CA-TUL-1), Tulare County, CA.  At the time of removal, the site was on private land.\\n\\n        The site was excavated prior to the construction of the Terminus Dam by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Human remains representing two individuals were recovered from burials, while human remains representing as many as four individuals were recovered from midden contexts.  No known individuals were identified.  The five associated funerary objects are three animal bones, one tubular bone bead, and one lithic fragment.\\n        Burial contexts identify the human remains removed from the Greasy Creek site as Native American.  According to the cultural resource specialist from the Santa Rosa Rancheria, the site is located within the traditional territory of the Yokut Indians.  The associated funerary objects are consistent with Native American burial goods found in the area.  Based on site location, the upper levels of the site may be identified with the Wukchumni Yokuts historic site of \\xc4\\x8doi\\xc5\\xa1i \\xc5\\xa1yu (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdog place\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  Materials from the upper levels of the site are generally comparable to materials from the nearby village of Slick Rock, which dates to the period prior to contact.\\n        \\n          Determinations. Under 25 U.S.C. 3003, Federal agency officials determined that the human remains represent the physical remains of six individuals of Native American ancestry.  Federal agency officials determined that the five objects are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.  Federal agency officials determined that the human remains and associated funerary objects are culturally affiliated or have a cultural relationship with the Indian tribes and groups listed above in Summary.\\n        \\n          Notification.
