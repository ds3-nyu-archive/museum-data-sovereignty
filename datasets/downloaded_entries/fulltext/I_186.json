The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Bluff Siding site, Buffalo County, WI and the Britt-Decora site, Trempealeau County, WI.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3) and 43 CFR 10.11(d).

The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Wisconsin Historical Society professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Forest County Potawatomi Community, Wisconsin; Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin; Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation of Wisconsin; Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin; and the Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota, hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Consulted Tribes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In 1979, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Bluff Siding site (47-BF-0045) in Buffalo County, WI, during an extensive excavation conducted by the Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS) for a Department of Transportation project expanding State Highway 35. The archeologists recovered fragmentary human remains representing an adult individual of indeterminate sex. The human remains were found in two distinct locations, both of which were located in the eastern half of the site. A burial context was recognized at one of these locations that had been disturbed by rodent and root activity. Three clam shells found with these human remains were classified by the excavating archeologists as associated funerary objects, but are not in WHS collections. The human remains found in the second location were scattered among numerous clam shells and faunal remains, but were not identified until formal analysis of materials in the laboratory occurred. No known individuals were identified. The one associated funerary object is a soil sample containing clamshell fragments.\\n\\n        In 1927, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from the Britt-Decora site (47-TR-0002) in Trempealeau County, WI. Archeologist Leland Cooper, who was associated with Hamline University in Minnesota at the time, excavated the site in 1927, and recovered the partially cremated remains of a single adult from one of the site\\'s 25 conical mounds. The human remains were transferred from Hamline University to the Wisconsin Historical Society in 1978. Neither field notes nor reports from Cooper\\'s investigations were among the transferred materials. No known individuals were identified.
