Dr. Wheat acquired this item from an unknown individual. The sacred object and object of cultural patrimony is a Monsterway Protectionway medicine bundle (jish) (catalog # 22437a-y). The dimensions are 10.7cm \\xc3\\x97 0.9cm.\\n        In the spring of 1977, Muriel Sibell Wolle, former University of Colorado art and art history professor, bequeathed to the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History two cultural items. Professor Wolle acquired these items on an unknown date from an unknown individual. The two sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony are Keet\\'aan Yalti\\'i (Twin Fetish Gods) (catalog # 26691) and Ha\\'da\\'honiye\\' (Mirage Stone) (catalog # 26692). The Twin Fetish Gods are comprised of one light colored stone and one mostly dark banded stone. Both stones have four inlays, three of which are turquoise and a fourth abalone. These inlays are located at the wider end of the stones and are arranged in a quadrate pattern. Multicolored yarn (red, green, purple, orange, and white) encircles almost three quarters of the two stones. Three tabular abalone shells measuring 2.5cm \\xc3\\x97 5cm are attached by twine to the yarn. A number of peacock, bluebird, and other unidentified feathers are inserted between the stones and the yarn. The Mirage Stone is a solid cylinder of grayish-white mirage/aragonite stone. Both ends of the cylinder are bordered with an inlay of green turquoise chips.\\n\\n        In 1979, H. Jackson Clark, Sr., owner of the Toh-Atin Gallery, Durango, CO, donated one cultural item to the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.

The sacred object and object of cultural patrimony is a Keet\\'aan Yalti\\'i (Twin Fetish Gods) with pouch (catalog # 1983.47.1 A-B (34509 A-B)). The twin fetish is comprised of two stones, one white and one striated gray with feather headdresses and facial features of small inlaid turquoise. Identical animal forms are bound to the front and back of each with multicolored yarn wrappings. Also tied to them with yarn is a small buckskin infant-like figure. Below the yarn wrapping is a beaded buckskin kilt with buckskin ties and fringe of colored yarn. Their overall dimensions are 15.5cm x 4.5cm.\\n        In September of 1984, H. Jackson Clark, Sr., owner of the Toh-Atin Gallery, Durango, CO, donated one cultural item to the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.

The anthropological literature, including the work of Leland C. Wyman, also supports cultural affiliation. During consultation, the Navajo representatives described and demonstrated the purpose and use of many of items.
