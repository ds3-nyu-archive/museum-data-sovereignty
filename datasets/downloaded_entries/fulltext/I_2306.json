At some time \\nduring the 1960s, these human remains were transferred from the \\nUniversity of Kansas to KSHS. No known individual was identified. No \\nassociated funerary objects are present.\\n    At an unknown date, human remains representing one individual were \\nremoved from the Anthony site (14HP1, or Dow Mandeville site), Harper \\nCounty, KS reportedly following their exposure during road construction \\nby Sydney Large, who donated the human remains to KSHS in 1988. No \\nknown individual was identified. The seven associated funerary objects \\nare pottery sherds.\\n    Based on the estimated age of the human remains; and their \\nosteological identification as Mongoloid, both individuals have been \\nidentified as Native American. Based on material culture and geographic \\nlocation, the Anthony site has been identified as a Bluff Creek complex \\noccupation dating from c. 1020 A.D. Based on temporal position, \\ngeographic location, and the general character of material culture, the \\nBluff Creek complex has been identified as possibly being ancestral to \\nthe Wichita tribe.\\n    In 1969, human remains representing one individual were recovered \\nfrom site 14BA401, Barber County, KS during excavations conducted by \\nKSHS archeologists. No known individual was identified. The eight \\nassociated funerary objects include ceramics, a catlinite pipe \\nfragment, bison bone, turtle shell, and a mollusc shell.\\n    Based on the archeological context and associated funerary objects, \\nthis individual has been identified as Native American. Based on \\nmaterial culture, site 14BA401 has been identified as a Pratt Complex \\noccupation dating to the late precontact period. Based on temporal \\nposition; geographic location; and the general character of material \\nculture, particularly the use of grass houses, the Pratt Complex has \\nbeen identified as possibly being ancestral to the Wichita tribe.\\n    In 1967, human remains representing two individuals were recovered \\nfrom site 14HP5 in Harper County, KS by KSHS archeologists following \\nthe exposure of the remains due to roadwork. No known individuals were \\nidentified. The 37 associated funerary objects include shell disc beads \\nand one piece of ocher.\\n    Based on archeological context, burial location, and associated \\nfunerary objects, these individuals have been identified as Native \\nAmerican. Based on\\n\\n[[Page 12350]]\\n\\nmaterial culture, site 14HP5 has been identified as a Bluff Creek \\nComplex occupation dating from ca. 1020 A.D. Based on temporal \\nposition, geographic location, and the general character of material \\nculture, the Bluff Creek Complex has been identified as possibly being \\nancestral to the Wichita tribe.\\n    During the 1960s, human remains representing one individual from \\nthe Saxman site (14RC301), Rice County, KS were donated to KSHS by \\nRalph Thode, who reportedly removed the remains from the site\\'s \\nsurface. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary \\nobjects are present.\\n    Based on the reported association of these remains with the Saxman \\nsite, this individual has been identified as Native American. Based on \\nmaterial culture, the Saxman site has been identified as a village \\noccupation of the Little River Focus of the Great Bend Aspect (1400-\\n1600 A.D). Based on temporal position, geographic location, material \\nculture, radiocarbon dates, and historic documents originating with the \\nCoronado expedition of 1541, the Little River Focus is considered to be \\na proto-historic manifestation of the present-day Wichita tribe.\\n    In 1934, human remains representing one individual from the Paint \\nCreek site (14MP1) were excavated by Nebraska State Historical Society \\npersonnel. In 1987, these human remains were transferred from the \\nNebraska State Historical Society to the KSHS. No known individual was \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n    Based on the archeological context of the human remains, this \\nindividual has been identified as Native American. Based on material \\nculture, the Paint Creek site has been identified as a village \\noccupation of the Little River Focus of the Great Bend Aspect (1400-\\n1600 A.D.). Based on temporal position, geographic location, material \\nculture, radiocarbon dates, and historic documents originating with the \\nCoronado expedition of 1541, the Little River Focus is considered to be \\na proto-historic manisfestation of the present-day Wichita tribe.\\n    In 1995, human remains representing two individuals from the \\nCountry Club site (14CO3), Cowley County, KS were recovered during \\nlegally authorized excavations conducted by KSHS archeologists. No \\nknown individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects were \\npresent.\\n    Based on archeological context, these individuals have been \\nidentified as Native American. Based on material culture, the Country \\nClub site has been identified as a village occupation of the Lower \\nWalnut Focus of the Great Bend Aspect (1400-1700 A.D.). Based on \\ntemporal position, geographic location, material culture, radiocarbon \\ndates, and historic documents originating with the Onate expedition of \\n1601, the Lower Walnut Focus is considered to be a proto-historic \\nmanifestation of the present-day Wichita tribe.\\n    In 1995, human remains representing two individuals from site \\n14CO331, Cowley County, KS were recovered during legally authorized \\nexcavations conducted by KSHS archeologists. No known individuals were \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects were present.\\n    Based on archeological context, these individuals have been \\nidentified as Native American.

No known individuals were \\nidentified. No associated funerary objects were present.\\n    Based on archeological context, these individuals have been \\nidentified as Native American. Due to the extremely fragmented nature \\nof the human remains from this site, the minimum number of individuals \\nwas based on one individual per each storage pit for this village. \\nBased on material culture and radiocarbon dates, site 14CO385 has been \\nidentified as a village occupation of the Lower Walnut Focus of the \\nGreat Bend Aspect (1400-1700 A.D.).

Lastly, officials \\nof the Kansas State Historical Society have determined that, pursuant \\nto 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity \\nwhich can be reasonably traced between these Native American human \\nremains and associated funerary objects and the Wichita and Affiliated \\nTribes.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Wichita and \\nAffiliated Tribes. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Randall Thies, \\nArcheologist, Kansas State Historical Society, 6425 SW Sixth Avenue, \\nTopeka, KS 66606-1099; telephone: (913) 272-8681, ext. 267, before \\nApril 12, 1999.
