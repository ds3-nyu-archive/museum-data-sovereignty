According to museum documentation, the human remains, consisting of a mummified head, were found by two Native American boys and subsequently collected by Esther Gibson, an Alaskan missionary. The mummified head was in a burial box containing a cedar bark basket used for cremation ashes, a buckskin pouch, and the scalp of a Caucasian man. Esther Gibson delivered the human remains and funerary objects to Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, who donated them to the Kingman Museum of Natural History in 1904. No known individuals were identified.

The location of the burial is within the historically documented territory of the Tlingit Indians. Based on burial practices and the styles of associated funerary objects, the human remains are post-contact, and likely date to the mid 19th century.
