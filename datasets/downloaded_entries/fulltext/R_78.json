The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        History and Description of the Cultural Items\\n        On September 28, 1938, two cultural items were removed from the Laws site (1MS100) on Pine Island in Marshall County, AL, after TVA acquired the land on April 21, 1937. There appear to have been at least four occupations at site 1MS100: A pre-ceramic period with steatite vessels; a village period with limestone-tempered pottery during the Flint River phase (A.D. 500-1000); a late Mississippian occupation with shell-tempered ceramics and rectilinear wall trench structures (Crow Creek phase, A.D. 1500-1700); and burials with Euro-American trade goods (circa A.D. 1670-1715). The two unassociated funerary objects are one brass pendant and one brass ring.\\n        Excavation records from site 1MS100 indicated that these two unassociated funerary objects were found in burial unit 1 with the fragmentary remains of a child. The human remains are no longer present. The brass ring found in burial unit 1 is similar to the brass rings found in burial units 17 and 40 of the same site which were also child burials. In a separate Notice of Inventory Completion, the human remains from burial units 17 and 40 have been culturally affiliated to Native American descendants of the Koasati/Kaskinampo. These descendants include the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; and The Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        On November 29, 1937, two unassociated funerary objects were excavated from burial unit 6 at site 1MS121 on Pine Island in Marshall County, AL, after TVA purchased the land on April 19, 1937. There were excavations in both the village and adjacent mound. There are no radiocarbon dates for this site. Artifacts recovered from the site indicate both a Woodland and Mississippian occupation. The two unassociated funerary objects are one Barton Incised jar and one Bell Plain carinated bowl. Both ceramic vessels are from the Mississippian period.\\n\\n        Excavation documents indicate that burial unit 6 did contain human remains, with these funerary objects placed near the head of the individual. These human remains are no longer present. The unassociated funerary objects are similar to those found in burial units 2, 4, and 5 of the same site. In a separate Notice of Inventory Completion, the human remains from burial units 2, 4, and 5 have been culturally affiliated to Native American descendants of the Koasati/Kaskinampo. These descendants include the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; and The Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Chronicles from Spanish explorers of the 16th century and French explorers of the 17th and 18th century indicate the presence of chiefdom level tribal entities in the southeastern United States which resemble the Mississippian chiefdoms. Linguistic analysis of place names noted by multiple Spanish explorers indicates that Koasati speaking groups inhabited northeastern Alabama. Early maps and research into the historic Native American occupation of northeastern Alabama indicates that the Koasati (as called by the English) or the Kaskinampo (as called by the French) were found at multiple sites in Jackson and Marshall Counties in the 17th and 18th centuries. Oral history, traditions, and expert opinions of the descendants of Koasati/Kaskinampo indicate that this portion of the Tennessee River valley was a homeland of the Koasati/Kaskinampo people. The subsequent involuntary diaspora of these peoples resulted in descendants of the Koasati/Kaskinampo among multiple federally recognized Indian Tribes.\\n        Determinations Made by the Tennessee Valley Authority\\n        Officials of the Tennessee Valley Authority have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(B), the four cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from specific burial sites of Native American individuals.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; and The Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Dr. Thomas O.
