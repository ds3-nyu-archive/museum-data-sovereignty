The three associated funerary objects are three stone spalls.\\n        In 1955\\xe2\\x80\\x941956, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from 35\\xe2\\x80\\x94WA\\xe2\\x80\\x9417 in Wallowa County, OR, from a cairn burial by Mr. Coale.

The one associated funerary object is a shell pendant.\\n        The human remains and associated funerary objects are part of the Mt. Sheep Pleasant Valley Reservoir Survey project. All five sites are located on U.S. Forest Service property in the Snake River Canyon. The archeology, ethnography and history of the Snake River Canyon, including those areas from which the human remains were removed, demonstrates a nearly continuous use of the area with numerous adaptations through time that lead inexorably to the occupation and utilization by a people who became identified in historic times as the Nee-Me\\xe2\\x80\\x94Poo or Nez Perce, the Weyiletpuu or Cayuse, Imatalamlama or Umatilla, and Waluulapam or Walla Walla. The oral traditions and oral histories of these groups place their people in the canyon \\xe2\\x80\\x9csince time immemorial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Descendants of the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla are members of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon. Descendants of the Nez Perce are members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; and Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho.\\n        Officials of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (9-10), the human remains described above represent the physical remains of six individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(A), the 72 objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary object and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; and Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact Jen Fitzpatrick, Customer Service Staff Officer, Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, 1550 Dewey Avenue, Baker City, OR 97814, telephone (541) 523-1222, before November 30, 2007. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; and/or Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        Wallowa-Whitman National Forest is responsible for notifying the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, Washington; Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon; and Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: October 1, 2007.\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
