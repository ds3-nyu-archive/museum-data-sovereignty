The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of these Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Phoebe A.

In 1940, Mr. Sharp donated these human remains to the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology. No known individual was identified. The 73 associated funerary objects (Cat.no. 1-64357) are pottery sherds and shell fragments.\\n        \\n        Based on manner of interment and the associated funerary objects, this individual has been identified as Native American. Based on strong geographical evidence, linguistic evidence, and manner of interment (cremation is generally a post-A.D. 1400 practice in this area), the preponderance of the evidence indicates cultural affiliation between these human remains and associated funerary objects and the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, California; Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Cuyapaipe Community of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Cuyapaipe Reservation, California; Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation, California; Sycuan Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Pala Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pala Reservation, California; Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians of the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation, California; Cahuilla Band of Mission Indians of the Cahuilla Reservation, California; Cabazon Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians of the Cabazon Reservation, California; Los Coyotes Band of the Cahuilla Mission Indians of the Los Coyotes Reservation, California; Morongo Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians of the Morongo Reservation, California; Ramona Band or Village of Cahuilla Mission Indians of California; Santa Rosa Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians of the Santa Rosa Reservation, California; Torres-Martinez Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians of California; and Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of one individual of Native American ancestry.
