Peabody Museum of Archaeology, Andover MA. The associated funerary objects were removed from the Mansion Inn site, Wayland, MA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederation, representing the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe (previously listed as the Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribal Council, Inc.) and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) as well as the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation and the Nipmuc Nation (non-federally recognized Indian groups).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        In June 1959, 188 associated funerary objects were removed from the Mansion Inn site (19-MD-210) in Middlesex County, MA. At that time, human remains and funerary objects were removed from the site by a number of individuals when construction activity at the site of the old Mansion Inn revealed the presence of archeological features. The site was looted by local children, their parents, and friends, assisted by local collectors. Many kept what they had excavated, though some human remains and funerary objects were preserved in museum collections. Frederick Johnson, curator of the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology (now the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology) undertook salvage excavations to recover some information about the site. Human remains and funerary objects removed by Johnson, Curtis Chapin, and others were ultimately preserved in the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and the Massachusetts Archaeological Society/Robbins Museum. The 188 associated funerary objects are 3 adze fragments, 1 axe fragment, 61 bifaces and biface fragments, 25 flakes/debitage, 1 hammerstone, 2 charred nut hulls and charcoal, 22 pebbles, and 73 stone fragments.\\n        Excavations, studies, and one radiocarbon assay on organic material date the site from approximately 2111 to 1697 B.C. This is consistent with the Watertown Phase and subsequent Coburn Group of the Late Archais Susquehanna Tradition. Multiple lines of evidence guided by tribal consultations, including geographic location, maps, oral tradition, linguistic, and archeological data, demonstrate a shared group identity between the human remains and associated funerary objects in this notice and the Wampanoag Repatriation Confederation, representing the Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribe (previously listed as the Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribal Council, Inc.) and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) as well as the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation and the Nipmuc Nation (non-federally recognized Indian groups).\\n        Determinations Made by the Robert S.
