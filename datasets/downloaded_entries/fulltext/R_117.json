In 1902, William Wynkoop Smith collected the cultural items during his visit to the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. The items remained in the Smith home in Saint Cloud, MN and later Cold Spring, MN. In 1982, Smith donated the items to the museum. The two sacred objects are ceremonial clubs. When the items were donated to the museum in 1982, the Curator identified them as Anishinaabe. Further research into beadwork and design confirm the items are of Anishinaabe origin.\\n        At an unknown date between 1930 and 1982, three cultural items were removed from the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe in Mahnomen, Clearwater and Becker Counties, MN. The three sacred objects are one drum, one rattle and one headband. The drum was owned by Charlotte Fineday Broker, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe who lived with the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe her entire life. Broker died in 1951 and her daughter-in-law Martha Aspinwall Broker, also a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, acquired the item. Martha married Charlotte\\'s son Robert in 1918, moved to Royalton, MN by 1930 and St. Cloud, MN by 1943. It is unclear when, between 1930 and 1982, the three sacred objects left the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. In 1982, Martha Broker donated all three items to the museum.\\n        Determinations Made by the Stearns History Museum\\n        Officials of the Stearns History Museum have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(C), the 5 cultural items described above are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the sacred objects and White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to claim these cultural items should submit a written request with information in support of the claim to Adam Smith, Stearns History Museum, 235 South 33rd Avenue, Saint Cloud, MN 56301, telephone (320) 253-8424, email asmith@stearns-museum.org, by November 17, 2016.
