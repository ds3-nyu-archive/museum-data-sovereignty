The item was reportedly found in association with a human burial, but the human remains are not present in the collections. In December 1950, the Gila Pueblo Foundation closed and the item was donated to the Arizona State Museum. In 1953, the cultural item was transferred to the Field Museum of Natural History as a permanent loan. In 2013, the Field Museum transferred control of the item back to the Arizona State Museum. The unassociated funerary object is a stone bowl.\\n        Queen Creek Ruin was a large habitation site that included trash mounds, burials, pithouses, canals, adobe compounds, and a ballcourt. Architectural features, the mortuary program, ceramic types, and other items of material culture are consistent with the Hohokam archaeological tradition and indicate occupation between approximately A.D. 950 and 1450.\\n        Continuities of mortuary practices, ethnographic materials, and technology indicate affiliation of Hohokam settlements with present-day O\\'odham (Piman) and Puebloan cultures. On April 13, 2011, representatives of the Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona, submitted documentation that addresses continuities between the Hohokam and the O\\'odham tribes.
