A bone harpoon head, a modified beaver tooth, and \\nseveral animal and fish bone fragments were found associated with the \\neight individuals. Radiocarbon assays indicate the burial site dates \\nbetween 1035-1155 AD. The human remains and associated funerary objects \\nhave been catalogued as ACAD-5747, 5749, 5750, 5751, 5752, 5783, 5784. \\nThe partial remains of an eighth individual (an elderly male) was also \\nrecovered in 1977 from a second grave at the Fernald Point Site. No \\nassociated funerary objects were recovered with this individual. \\nRadiocarbon assays indicate the second burial site dates between 480-\\n680 AD. The human remains have been catalogued as ACAD-5748. The human \\nremains and associated funerary objects of all nine individuals are \\ncurrently in the possession of the University of Maine, Orono, ME.\\n    Inventory of the human remains and associated funerary objects and \\nreview of the accompanying documentation indicates that no known \\nindividuals were identifiable. A representative of the Wabanaki Tribes \\nof Maine has identified the Acadia National Park area as a historic \\ngathering place for his people and stated his belief that there exists \\na relationship of shared group identity between these individuals and \\nthe Wabanaki Tribes of Maine. The Prehistoric Subcommittee of the Maine \\nState Historic Preservation Office\\'s Archaeological Advisory Committee \\nhas found it reasonable to trace a shared group identity from the Late \\nPrehistoric Period (1000-1500 AD) inhabitants of Maine as an undivided \\nwhole to the four modern Indian tribes known collectively as the \\nWabanaki Tribes of Maine on the basis of geographic proximity; \\nsurvivals of stone, ceramic and perishable material culture skills; and \\nprobable linguistic continuity across the Late Prehistoric/Contact \\nPeriod boundary. In a 1979 article, Dr. David Sanger, the archeologist \\nwho conducted the 1977 excavations at the Fernald Point Site and \\nuncovered the abovementioned burials, recognizes a relationship between \\nMaine sites dating to the Ceramic Period (2,000 B.P. - 1600 A.D.) and \\npresent-day Algonkian speakers generally known as Abenakis, including \\nthe Micmac, Maleseet, Passamaquoddy, Penboscot, Kennebec, and Pennacook \\ngroups.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the National \\nPark Service have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), \\nthere is a relationship of shared group identity which can be \\nreasonably traced between these human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects and the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Wabanaki Tribes of \\nMaine. Representatives of any other Indian tribe which believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects should contact Len Bobinchock, Acting Superintendent, \\nAcadia National Park, P.O. Box 177, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, telephone: \\n(207) 288-0374, before August 31, 1994. Repatriation of these human \\nremains and associated funerary objects to the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine \\nmay begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: July 21, 1994\\nFrancis P.
