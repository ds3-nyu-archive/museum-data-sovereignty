The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the associated funerary objects was made by TVA professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Cherokee Nation; Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); The Chickasaw Nation; The Choctaw Nation; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma (hereafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Consulted Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        The sites listed in this notice were excavated as part of TVA\\'s Wheeler reservoir project by the Alabama Museum of Natural History (AMNH) at the University of Alabama, using labor and funds provided by the Works Progress Administration. Details regarding this site may be found in The Flint River Site, MA48, by William S. Webb and David L. DeJarnette and An Archaeological Survey of Wheeler Basin on the Tennessee River in Northern Alabama, by William S. Webb. The associated funerary objects listed in this notice have been in the physical custody of the AMNH at the University of Alabama since excavation but are under the control of TVA. The human remains and other associated funerary objects were previously listed in a Notice of Inventory Completion (81 FR 60380-60381, September 1, 2016) and transferred to The Chickasaw Nation. Additional funerary objects were found during a recent improvement in the curation of the TVA archeological collections at AMNH.\\n        From June to December 1938, excavations took place at the Flint River site, 1MA48, in Madison County, AL. Excavation commenced after TVA had acquired the two parcels of land encompassing site 1MA48 on November 11, 1935 and July 3, 1936. Excavations revealed multiple occupations, including the Late Archaic (4000-1000 B.C.) period, Colbert (300 B.C.-A.D. 100), Flint River (A.D. 500-1000), and the early Mississippian Langston phase (A.D. 900-1200). The one associated funerary object is a sandstone bowl.\\n        From May to June 1934, excavations took place at site 1LA13 in Lawrence County, AL. Excavation commenced after TVA purchased this land February 14, 1934. Site 1LA13 was one of the first sites excavated on TVA land in north Alabama. Information about the excavations is not abundant. Excavations revealed this site to be a burial mound. All the burials were considered inclusive to the mound, not intruded into it at a later date. An examination of the funerary objects excavated at this site indicates that this mound was created during the Hobbs Island phase of the Mississippian period (A.D. 1200-1500).
