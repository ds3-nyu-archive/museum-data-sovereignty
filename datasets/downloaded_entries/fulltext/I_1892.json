The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Redding Number 1 site (CA-Sha-47), Shasta County, CA, and the Frank Pierce site (CA-Tri-58), Trinity County, CA.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003 (d)(3).

No known individuals were identified.  The 27 associated funerary objects are 22 shell beads, 2 shell pendants, 2 pieces of baked clay, and 1 piece of ochre.\\n        Based on the presence of chronologically diagnostic artifacts in the burials and in other areas of the site, the Redding Number 1 site is dated to circa A.D. 1600 and later.\\n        In 1957, human remains representing at least two individuals were removed from the Frank Pierce site (CA-Tri-58), on the Trinity River, Trinity County, CA, during excavations carried out by the University of California, Berkeley.
