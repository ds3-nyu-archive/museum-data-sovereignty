The wooden stem is carved in \\nalternating spiral and disc shapes, and the spiral sections have \\nyellow, blue, and red paints applied. Attached to the stem is one \\nbroken semi-tanned thong and two additional thongs threaded through \\nfive tubular bone sections followed by a tin cone at the end.\\n\\n[[Page 1873]]\\n\\n    In 1928, this pipe was donated to the Oklahoma Historical Society \\nby Mr. W.T. Gault (Goit Collection). Donor information indicates that \\nW.P. Campbell collected this pipe in Oklahoma City in 1911 from Burnt-\\nAll-Over. Accession records list this pipe as ``Cheyenne.\\'\\' However, a \\n1914 publication of the Society\\'s Historia states that Mr. Goit \\n``received these items directly from the hands of the original owners\\'\\' \\nand that the donation was actually made in 1914.\\n    No information is known by the Oklahoma Historical Society or has \\nbeen presented by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana regarding the \\npipe\\'s possession by Burnt-All-Over (1837-1917). Oral tradition \\nevidence presented by representatives of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of \\nMontana, including Mr. James Blackwolf, Keeper of the Sacred Medicine \\nHat Bundle, indicates this pipe originally came from the Sacred \\nMedicine Hat Bundle. Representatives of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of \\nMontana have indicated this pipe is necessary for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religion by present-day adherents. \\nRepresentatives of the Northern Cheyenne have further stated that \\n``This Pipe was and still is essential to the wholeness and well-being \\nof the Sacred Hat, a sacred covenant of the Cheyenne People which has \\nbeen with them since time immemorial.\\'\\' Finally, representatives of the \\nNorthern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana have stated that this pipe has \\nongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the \\nculture itself and could not be alienated by any individual.\\n    Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Oklahoma \\nHistorical Society have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(3), this cultural item is specific ceremonial objects needed by \\ntraditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of \\ntraditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. \\nOfficials of the Oklahoma Historical Society have determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(4), this cultural item has ongoing \\nhistorical, traditional, and cultural importance central to the culture \\nitself, and could not have been alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by \\nany individual. Officials of the Oklahoma Historical Society have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship \\nof shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between this \\nitem and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Cheyenne and Arapaho \\nTribes of Oklahoma and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these objects should contact Jeffrey Briley, \\nRegistrar, Oklahoma Historical Society, 2100 N.
