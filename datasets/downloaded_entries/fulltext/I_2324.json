Also in \\n1934, these human remains were transferred to the Peabody Museum of \\nArchaeology and Ethnology. No known individuals were identified. The \\nfive associated funerary objects include a triangular brass projectile \\npoint with attached sinew, a box of yellow ochre, a Native-made ceramic \\nsherd, and two bark containers. During the 1950s, these objects were \\ndonated to the Plimoth Plantation by Harry Hornblower.\\n    The documentation associated with the objects indicates these \\nobjects were associated with the human remains from the Hornblower \\nproperty at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Based on \\nthe presence of the brass projectile point, the burials have been \\nestimated to date to the early historic period or later, post 1600 A.D. \\nHistoric documents (including the 1606 Champlain Map of Port Saint \\nLouis) and oral tradition indicate the presence of Wampanoag in this \\narea during this time. The Eel River in Plymouth, MA is located within \\nthe traditional territory of the Wampanoag during the early historic \\nperiod.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Peabody \\nMuseum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Plimoth Plantation have \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains \\nlisted above represent the physical remains of two individuals of \\nNative American ancestry. Officials of the Peabody Museum of \\nArchaeology and Ethnology and the Plimoth Plantation have also \\ndetermined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the five objects \\nlisted above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near \\nindividual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the \\ndeath rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the Peabody Museum of \\nArchaeology and Ethnology and the Plimoth Plantation have determined \\nthat, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared \\ngroup identity which can be reasonably traced between these Native \\nAmerican human remains and associated funerary objects and the \\nWampanoag Repatriation Confederation on behalf of the Wampanoag Tribe \\nof Gay Head; and the Mashpee Wampanoag and the Assonet Band of the \\nWampanoag Nation, two non-Federally recognized Indian groups.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Wampanoag \\nRepatriation Confederation on behalf of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay \\nHead; and the\\n\\n[[Page 58418]]\\n\\nMashpee Wampanoag and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation, two \\nnon-Federally recognized Indian groups. Representatives of any other \\nIndian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with \\nthese human remains and associated funerary objects should contact \\nBarbara Isaac, Repatriation Coordinator, Peabody Museum of Archaeology \\nand Ethnology, 11 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138; telephone: (617) \\n496-2254; and/or Karin Goldstein, Curator of Original Collections, \\nPlimoth Plantation, PO Box 1620, Plymouth, MA 02362; telephone (508) \\n746-1622, ext. 379, before November 30, 1998. Repatriation of the human \\nremains and associated funerary objects to the Wampanoag Repatriation \\nConfederation on behalf of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head; and the \\nMashpee Wampanoag and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation, two \\nnon-Federally recognized Indian groups may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: October 22, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
