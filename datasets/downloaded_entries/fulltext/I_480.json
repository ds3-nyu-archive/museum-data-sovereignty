In 1993, the human remains were anonymously mailed to a member of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. An unsigned handwritten note was included with the remains indicating that they had been excavated approximately 30 years prior from Florida, and that the sender believed the remains were Native American, and possibly Seminole. The tribal member contacted the Seminole Police Department, who then took possession of the remains. The remains were placed in the Seminole Police Department evidence vault as it was unknown if they were of modern forensic significance. In 2009, the remains were examined by the Broward County Medical Examiner\\'s Office, and in 2013, the remains were examined by the Tribal Historic Preservation Office. The remains were determined to be archeological. The human remains include one partial cranium, a separate partial maxilla and mandible, and three cervical vertebrae. Both individuals were adults based on dental wear and cranial suture closure. One individual was likely female and the other male, based on cranio-facial features associated with sexual morphology. The remains were determined to be those of prehistoric Native American individuals, based on condition and anatomy associated with ancestry. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        Based on the description in the hand written letter that accompanied the remains, as well as the decision of ancestry recorded in the osteological examination performed by District 17 Medical Examiner, the remains are determined to be those of early Seminole Native Americans.
