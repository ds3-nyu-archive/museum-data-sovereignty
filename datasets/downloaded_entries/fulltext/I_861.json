The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (previously listed as the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon).\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        Sometime before 2000, possibly in 1988, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from an unknown location in Walla Walla County, WA. The human remains were at the University of Idaho from some unknown date until 2000, when they were transferred to the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University. Notes at the University of Idaho state the human remains were collected on March 21, 1988, but no additional information was located. No known individuals were identified. The eight associated funerary objects are 2 freshwater mussel shells, 1 bone awl, 2 smooth pebbles, 2 fragmentary pieces of bird bone, and 1 fragment of a chipped stone tool.\\n        The human remains were determined to be Native American based on the nature of the dental wear and the character of the associated funerary objects. Present-day cultural affiliation was based on the generalized location from which the remains were removed in Walla Walla County, WA. The character of the associated funerary objects suggests the human remains probably date to the late prehistoric period or between 2000 and 500 years ago.\\n        Determinations Made by the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University\\n        Officials of the Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of one individual of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the eight objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (previously listed as the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Oregon).\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Mary Collins, Museum of Anthropology at Washington State University, P.O.
