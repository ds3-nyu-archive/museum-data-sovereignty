The human remains were donated to the University of Minnesota in 1964, and accessioned as UM549. In 1966, the human remains were transferred to the Clay County Historical Society (Acc. 66.36) and in 1986, they were transferred to the MIAC (H113-4). No known individuals were identified.

These human remains have no archeological classification and cannot be associated with any present-day Indian tribe.\\n        In 1939, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were recovered from a gravel pit in Ottertail County, MN, by a Works Progress Administration crew and were transferred to the University of Minnesota (UM222).

The human remains were purportedly reburied, except for the skull fragments, which were donated to the owner of a local bar. After the death of the bar owner, the reconstructed skull was reburied near Big Pine Lake. In 2009, the same skull was recovered during power line construction on residential property on Big Pine Lake. The human remains were transferred into the custody of the Ottertail County Sheriff\\'s Office and from there to the MIAC (H442). No known individuals were identified.
