No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary \\nobjects are present.\\n    Morphological evidence indicates this individual is Native Hawaiian \\nbased on cranial appearence. This individual was most likely brought \\nback to Springfield, MA, by a whaler or sailor who visited the Hawaiian \\nIslands, then known as the Sandwich Islands. The cranium is labeled \\n``Sandwich Islands.\\'\\' Consultation evidence provided by representatives \\nof Hui Malama I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei indicate that shoreline sand \\ndunes, caves, and cliff caves were the locations of exclusively Native \\nHawaiian burials into the early historic period, and locations easily \\naccessible to whalers and sailors of the period.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nSpringfield Science Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical \\nremains of one individual of Native American ancestry. Lastly, \\nofficials of the Springfield Science Museum have determined that, \\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these Native American \\nhuman remains and Hui Malam I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of Hui Malama I Na Kupuna \\'O \\nHawai\\'i Nei and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Representatives of any \\nother Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that believes itself \\nto be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact  \\nJohn Pretola, Curator of Anthropology, Springfield Science Museum, 236 \\nState Street, Springfield, MA 01103, telephone (413) 263-6875, ext. \\n320, before July 14, 1997. Repatriation of the human remains to Hui \\nMalama I Na Kupuna \\'O Hawai\\'i Nei may begin after that date if no \\nadditional claimants come forward.\\nDated: June 2, 1997.\\nFrancis P.
