The Black Mesa Archaeological Project (BMAP), conducted by staff and students from Prescott College and, later, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIU), gathered archeological and anthropological data on Black Mesa. Initially, the collections were housed at Prescott College. In 1974, Prescott College declared bankruptcy and closed.

The three unassociated funerary objects are cloth fragments from burial blankets.\\n        In July 1971, 110 cultural items were removed from a site on or near Black Mesa in Navajo County, AZ.
