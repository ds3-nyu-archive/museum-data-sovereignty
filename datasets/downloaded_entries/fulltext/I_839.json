The human remains were removed from Wilson, Kinney, and Wharton Counties, TX.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Texas A&M University (TAMU) professional staff in 1995. In 2010, representatives of the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; and the Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma were invited to consult with TAMU for the purpose of determining the place and manner of the repatriation. The Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma contacted TAMU with an interest in having these remains repatriated; no representatives from the other tribes contacted TAMU in response to this invitation.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n        From July 1985 to August 1985, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were removed from the Wilson County Project Site (41WN73), in Wilson County, TX, as part of a salvage excavation run through the University of Texas at San Antonio. At the time of donation, these human remains were identified as being from Burial #1 (TAMU-NAGPRA 45), Burial #2 (TAMU-NAGPRA 46), and Burial #3 (TAMU-NAGPRA 47). The human remains were determined to be as follows: Burial #1, one adult of indeterminate sex; Burial #2, one adult of indeterminate sex; and Burial #3, one adult of indeterminate sex. Based on artifacts recovered from the site, the human remains were determined to be prehistoric. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1978, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from private land in Kinney County, TX, and donated to TAMU (TAMU-NAGPRA 48). At the time of donation, it was indicated that the human remains were probably prehistoric, without further explanation. Analysis of the human remains by physical anthropologists indicates that this individual was of Native American origins. The human remains were determined to be one adult female and one adult male. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In 1986, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from private land in Wharton County, TX, and donated to TAMU (TAMU-NAGPRA 56). The two associated funerary objects are a lead bullet and ceramic pipe. The associated funerary objects date the human remains to 1840-1870 A.D. Analysis of the human remains by physical anthropologists indicates that this individual was of Native American origins. The human remains were determined to be one adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified.\\n        Based on geographic location of all the sites in this notice, TAMU staff found it reasonable to trace a shared identity between the human remains in this notice and the following historic groups: Cantona, Ervipiame, Mayeye, Comanche, Kickapoo, Tonkawa, Coahuiltecan, and Lipan Apache. Archeological and linguistic evidence, historical records, and/or traditional beliefs indicate that there is a relationship of shared group identity between these historic groups and the present-day Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; and the Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\\n        Determinations Made by Texas A&M University\\n        Officials of Texas A&M University have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of six individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the two objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and the Comanche Nation, Oklahoma; Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; and the Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Suzanne L.
