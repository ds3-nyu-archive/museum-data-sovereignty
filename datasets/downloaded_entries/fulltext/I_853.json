The human remains and associated funerary objects were removed from the Cox site in Jackson County, AL.\\n        This notice is published as part of the National Park Service\\'s administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA, 25 U.S.C. 3003(d)(3). The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n\\n        A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by TVA professional staff in consultation with representatives of the University of Alabama and the Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma; Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas (previously listed as the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas); Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town; Cherokee Nation; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma; Kialegee Tribal Town; Poarch Band of Creeks (previously listed as the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama); Seminole Tribe of Florida (previously listed as the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Dania, Big Cypress, Brighton, Hollywood & Tampa Reservations)); Shawnee Tribe; The Chickasaw Nation; The Muscogee (Creek) Nation; The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma; Thlopthlocco Tribal Town; and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.\\n        History and Description of the Remains\\n\\n        From April 27, 1938, to November 10, 1939, human remains representing, at minimum, 19 individuals were removed from the Cox site (1JA176), in Jackson County, AL. The Cox site was excavated as part of TVA\\'s Guntersville reservoir project by the Alabama Museum of Natural History (AMNH) at the University of Alabama, using labor and funds provided by the Works Progress Administration. Excavation of the land commenced after TVA had acquired this land on July 19, 1937 for the Guntersville project. The excavation site was composed of a conical mound believed to have originally been a truncated pyramid, with multiple stratigraphic zones and also a village site containing most of the burial units. This site was occupied during the Crow Creek phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1600) at the end of the Mississippian period. Details regarding this site may be found in An Archaeological Survey of Guntersville Basin on the Tennessee River in Northern Alabama by William S. Webb and Charles G. Wilder. The human remains and associated funerary objects excavated from the Cox site have always been in the physical custody of the AMNH at the University of Alabama.\\n        The human remains include adults, juveniles, and infants of both sexes. No known individuals were identified. The 508 associated funerary objects are 6 shell-tempered bowls, 6 shell-tempered jars, 1 shell-tempered water bottle, 1 shell-tempered human effigy pot, 51 shell-tempered pot sherds, 3 pieces of a shell gorget, 3 intact shell gorgets, 422 shell beads, 1 bird bone tool, 1 shell hairpin, 7 bone awls, 1 greenstone celt, 4 projectile points, and 1 stone discoidal.\\n        Although there is no scientific certainty that Native Americans of the Crow Creek phase are directly related to modern Federally recognized tribes, Spanish explorers of the 16th century do indicate the presence of chiefdom level tribal entities in the southeastern United States. The Coosa paramount chiefdom noted in historical chronicles is the most likely entity related to Crow Creek sites in this part of the Guntersville Reservoir. Tribal groups or towns now part of The Muscogee (Creek) Nation claim descent from the Coosa chiefdom. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that in this part of the Guntersville Reservoir area, Crow Creek phase sites are most likely culturally associated with groups now part of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Determinations Made by the Tennessee Valley Authority\\n        Officials of TVA have determined that:\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of 19 individuals of Native American ancestry.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the 508 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects and The Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\\n        Additional Requestors and Disposition\\n\\n        Lineal descendants or representatives of any Federally recognized Indian tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Dr. Thomas O.
