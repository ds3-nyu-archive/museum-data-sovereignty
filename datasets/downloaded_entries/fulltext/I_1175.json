The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n        Consultation\\n        A detailed assessment of human remains was made by Bureau of Land Management professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Arapahoe Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming; Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, Montana; Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, Oklahoma; Crow Tribe of Montana; Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Montana; Rosebud Sioux Tribe of the Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota; and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation, Utah (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tribes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

Numerous human skeletons were discovered during construction of a waterfowl pond by the Wyoming State Game and Fish Department, four miles west of Huntley, WY. The individuals were apparently buried close to each other in shallow graves or laid on the ground and covered with dirt in what may have been a mound-like configuration. Over 40 carloads of interested townspeople and souvenir collectors from as far away as Cheyenne, WY, and Scottsbluff, NE, converged upon the site almost immediately after the bones were discovered, taking human skeletal remains and grave goods. On September 23, 1963, Dr. William Mulloy, University of Wyoming Anthropologist, and Dr. Paul McGrew, University of Wyoming Paleontologist, collected fragments of seven individuals that had been left by vandals. The general assemblage is highly fragmented, and includes the remains of three adult females, two adult males, one indeterminate adult, and one child. Subsequently in 1963, a skull from an adult male was given to Dr. Mulloy by Ted Miller of Gering, NE, which had been removed from the site. In 1994, additional fragmentary bone representing a minimum of one individual that had been collected from the site in 1963, was brought by Grant Willson of Cheyenne, WY, to the university. The human remains are curated at the University of Wyoming Human Remains Repository. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n\\n        In 1963, human remains representing a minimum of one individual were removed from the Table Mountain Fence Site (48GO48), in Goshen County, WY.
