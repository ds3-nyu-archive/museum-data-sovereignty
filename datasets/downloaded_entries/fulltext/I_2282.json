Hoffman, a graduate student at Harvard University and a crew \\nof students. No known individuals were identified. The 103 associated \\nfunerary objects include ceramic sherds, stone flakes, deer bones, \\nground stone tools and stone core fragments.\\n    Based on the associated funerary objects, these individuals have \\nbeen identified as Native American. Based on ceramic temper and styles, \\nthese burials date to the Bluff Culture of the Late Woodland Period \\n(700-900 A.D.). The Bluff Culture is at least partially ancestral to \\nthe Middle Mississippian Culture of southern Illinois. Based on \\ngeographical continuity, the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma is \\nlikely to be descendant of archeological cultures of the Woodland and \\nMississippian periods in central and southern Illinois.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the \\nUniversity Museum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), \\nthe human remains listed above represent the physical remains of 11 \\nindividuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the University \\nMuseum have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(2), the \\n103 objects listed above are reasonably believed to have been placed \\nwith or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as \\npart of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials of the University \\nMuseum have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a \\nrelationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced \\nbetween these Native American human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects and the  Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Peoria Tribe of \\nIndians of Oklahoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that \\nbelieves itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains \\nand associated funerary objects should contact Michael P. Hoffman, \\nCurator of Anthropology, University Museum, University of Arkansas, \\nFayetteville, AR 72702; telephone: (501) 575-3855, before August 23, \\n1999. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects \\nto the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma may begin after that date if \\nno additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: July 15, 1999.\\nFrancis P.
