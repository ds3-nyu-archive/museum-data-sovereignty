The site (45-OK-10) is located within the current boundaries of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The human remains and associated funerary objects were collected on a University of Washington Field Party possibly under the direction of Douglas Osborne, as a part of archeological investigations in Okanogan County in the Chief Joseph Reservoir. The human remains and associated funerary objects were received by the Burke Museum in 1950 (Burke Accn. #1966-92). No known individuals were identified. The 10 associated funerary objects include 1 lot of nails, 3 lots of unmodified wood and soil, 1 metal picture frame, 1 metal object (possible pillbox), 1 ceramic knob, 1 spoon, 1 composite artifact bag containing metal and fabric fragments, and 1 bag of fabric.\\n        \\n        Geographic, historic, and anthropological evidence indicates that the human remains are Native American. The site (45-OK-10) is located within the current boundaries of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. This area was historically and prehistorically occupied by the Interior Salishan group, the Nespelem. The artifacts from the site include both pre- and post-contact materials. A trade button dating between 1830-1845 was found at the site and indicates occupation during the historic time period. The site is located between two major Hudson\\'s Bay Company Forts, Fort Okanogan, which was in operation between 1812 to 1860, and Fort Colville, which was in operation between 1825-1870. There were few Euro-American settlers in the area until after 1900 (Osborne, Crabtree, and Brian 1952). Sites in the surrounding area (45OK159 and 45OK7) include historic funerary objects associated with Native American burials (Cook 2013). The Nespelem traditionally occupied the area surrounding the Nespelem River and the Columbia River to the confluence with the Okanogan River (Ruby and Brown 2010). The Nespelem speak Interior Salish.
