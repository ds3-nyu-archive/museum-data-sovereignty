Peabody Museum of \\nArchaeology, Phillips Academy, Andover, MA.\\n    A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Robert S. \\nPeabody Museum of Archaeology professional staff in consultation with \\nrepresentatives of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of Connecticut.\\n    In 1921 or 1922, human remains representing six individuals were \\nrecovered from the Ecclestone site, Noank, CT during Robert S. Peabody \\nMuseum excavations conducted by Warren K. Moorehead, museum curator. No \\nknown individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are \\npresent.\\n    Based on the Ecclestone site report, these individuals have been \\ndetermined to be Native American. A 1921 newspaper article indicates \\nthe Ecclestone site is an ``Indian burying ground\\'\\' located along the \\nMystic River, southwest of Mystic, CT. The Ecclestone site is located \\ncentrally in the area where principal Pequot villages existed from the \\nlate Woodland to the early historic period.\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Robert \\nS. Peabody Museum of Archaeology have determined that, pursuant to 43 \\nCFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical \\nremains of six individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of \\nthe Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology have also determined that, \\npursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group \\nidentity which can be reasonably traced between these Native American \\nhuman remains and the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe of Connnecticut.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Mashantucket Pequot \\nIndian Tribe of Connnecticut. Representatives of any other Indian tribe \\nthat believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human \\nremains should contact James W. Bradley, Director, Robert S. Peabody \\nMuseum of Archaeology, Phillips Academy, Andover, MA 01810; telephone: \\n(978) 749-4490, before October 28, 1998. Repatriation of the human \\nremains to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of Connecticut may begin after \\nthat date if no additional claimants come forward.\\nDated: September 14, 1998.\\nFrancis P.
