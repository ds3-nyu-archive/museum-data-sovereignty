White from Point Hope, North Slope Borough, AK, and later donated to the Burke Museum by his wife in 1904. The 33 unassociated funerary objects are 1 wooden mask, 4 ground stone tools, 1 lot of earthenware fragments, 1 ivory thimble holder, 1 needle, 1 needle case, 1 comb, 1 scoop, 1 pipe, 2 pipe bowls, 1 ivory tool, 3 ground stone knives, 2 stone points, 2 bone points, 2 harpoon heads, 1 scraper blade, 4 harpoon points, 1 lance, 1 sinew rope, and 2 adzes.\\n        In the late 19th century, one unassociated funerary object was removed from Point Hope, AK. It is believed that this object was also removed by James T. White and donated to Young Naturalist Society, who then donated it to the Burke Museum in 1904. The one unassociated funerary object is one lot of earthenware fragments. These fragments are labeled with the same writing and are given similar numbers to the other fragments from James T.
