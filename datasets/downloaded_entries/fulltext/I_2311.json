These sites include: CA-LAN-1296 (one possible \\nand three probable cremations); CA-KER-2060/H (one cremation and one \\ninhumation); CA-KER-2241 (one interment unknown type); CA-LAN-1158 (one \\ncremation); and CA-KER-796 (one interment, unknown type). No known \\nindividuals were identified. Associated funerary objects include three \\nprojectile points (two arrow points and one dart point), one bone tool, \\n18 shell beads, and two modified shell fragments. The ethnohistoric \\ninformation establishing the relationship between these tribes and the \\nNative American human remains and associated funerary objects consists \\nof ethnographies, language studies, Spanish mission records, oral \\ninterviews, and other sources (Earle 1997). No unassociated funerary \\nobjects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony were \\nidentified in the collection.\\n    In 1972, one human cranial bone fragment representing one \\nindividual was recovered from the surface during legally authorized \\nexcavations at the CA-LAN-1296 (AVAS-1; EAFB-1000) site by the Antelope \\nValley Archaeological Society (AVAS)(EAFB Historic Preservation Office \\nfile 72-A). No consultation was done at the time of the discovery of \\nthe cranial bone fragment. The cranial bone fragment (ISOCAT \\n2181; AVAS 1-38a) appears to have been part of a cremation interment. \\nNo associated funerary objects were found with the cranial bone \\nfragment.\\n    In 1988, Regional Environmental Consultants (RECON) conducted \\nlegally authorized test excavations at CA-LAN-1296 and recovered human \\nbone representing three individuals (Hector et al. 1988). The first \\nindividual is represented by 18 unidentified human bone fragments \\n(RECON CAT# 163-119a) that were surface collected from a probable \\ncremation interment in Unit 12 (Locus E). The artifacts found in \\nassociation with the 18 human bone fragments consist of five Olivella \\nsp. shell beads (RECON CAT 163-118, surface) and one Haliotis \\nsp. shell fragment (RECON CAT 163-119d, surface). On Edwards \\nAFB, Olivella sp. shell beads and Haliotis sp.shell generally date to \\nthe Gypsum through Late Periods (2000 B.C.-A.D. 1770). The second \\nindividual is represented by 180 human bone fragments that were surface \\ncollected from a probable cremation interment in Unit 18 (Locus E). The \\nhuman bone fragments consist of an orbit fragment, distal metacarpal \\nfragment (RECON CAT 163-196a), and 178 unidentified bone \\nfragments (RECON CAT 163-196b-d). The artifacts found in \\nassociation with the 180 human bone fragments include: one unidentified \\nshell fragment (RECON CAT 163-196f, surface); 12 unidentified \\nshell beads (RECON CAT 163-197, 0-10 cm); one Humboldt dart \\npoint (RECON CAT 163-199, 0-10 cm); and one Olivella sp. shell \\nbead (RECON CAT 163-201, 10-20 cm). Humboldt dart points and \\nOlivella sp. shell beads are diagnostic artifacts of the Gypsum Period \\n(2000 B.C--A.D. 500). The third individual is represented by one human \\ncranial bone fragment (RECON CAT 163-231a, 10-20 cm). The \\ncranial bone fragment was excavated from a probable cremation interment \\nin Unit 21 (Locus D). No associated funerary objects were found with \\nthe cranial bone fragment.\\n    The estimated date of occupation at the CA-LAN-1296 site is 5000 \\nB.C.-A.D. 1770 based on the presence of Pinto, Gypsum, Saratoga \\nSprings, and Late Period components (Earle et al. 1997a). Native \\nAmericans were not consulted at the time the human remains were \\nrecovered from the CA-LAN-1296 site. The human remains were not \\nidentified as such until they were examined by Dr. Rose Tyson of the \\nSan Diego Museum of Man during the NAGPRA inventory process. The \\ncultural affiliation of the human remains can not be positively \\ndetermined (Campbell et al. 1997). Ethnohistoric information, however, \\nindicates that the human remains may be affiliated with one of the five \\ntribes (Chemehuevi, Kawaiisu, Kitanemuk, Serrano, or Tataviam) who \\nutilized the region in historic times (Earle 1997). This is supported \\nby the site\\'s location in the vicinity of historic ``Ap\\'avutsiviat\\'\\' or \\nBuckhorn Springs (Earle 1997:59).\\n    In November 1985, the Base Historic Preservation Officer (BHPO), \\nRichard H. Norwood, recovered human bone representing two individuals \\n(one cremation; one inhumation) during an emergency investigation at \\nsite CA-KER-2060/H (EAFB-617)(EAFB Historic\\n\\n[[Page 1029]]\\n\\nPreservation Office files 85-041, 85-0). The first survey of the site \\nby the BHPO was done in April 1985 prior to the construction of a \\nsewage treatment pond (Norwood 1985). The remains were not found at \\nthat time. During the construction mechanical grading uncovered the \\nhuman bone. The BHPO\\'s emergency investigation of the site involved: \\n(1) a surface inspection of ``spoil\\'\\' piles; (2) excavation of the \\ninhumation with the assistance of Colonel H.P. Riessen, a US Air Force \\nReserve physical anthropologist; and (3) the excavation of seven 1 m x \\n1 m test units in different areas of the site. At the time the human \\nremains were collected, consultations were conducted with Native \\nAmericans (Kawaiisu [Lynn Bedabe]) and State and Federal agencies. \\nThese included the: State of California Native American Heritage \\nCommission (Annette Ospital); State of California Office of Historic \\nPreservation (Rob Jackson); National Park Service Interagency \\nArcheological Services (Holly Dunbar); and National Park Service \\nArcheological Assistance Division (Deborah Katz).\\n    The first individual at the CA-KER-2060/H site is represented by \\n239 burned human bone from a cremation interment in Units 1, 5, 6, and \\n7. The cremation was discovered in a 4 m-square area approximately 5 m \\nwest of the inhumation interment described below. The ISOCAT catalog \\nnumbers for the interment include: two burned femur fragments (1639b); \\n46 unidentified bone fragments (1673); 1 unidentified bone fragment \\n(1767); two right lower bicuspid fragments (1813, surface); five long \\nbone fragments, three cranial bone fragments, and small bone fragments \\n(1662, Unit 1, 10-20 cm); 58 unidentified bone fragments and 23 cranial \\nbone fragments (including thick parietal bone indicative of \\nanemia)(1663, Unit 1, 10-20 cm); one tooth fragment, two mandible \\nfragments, seven unidentified bone fragments (1763, 1763a-c, Unit 1, \\n20-30 cm); one tooth (1739, Unit 5, 10-20 cm); six tooth fragments \\n(including one root and one incisor fragment)(1745, Unit 5, 20-30 cm); \\none unidentified burned bone (1746, Unit 5, 20-30 cm); one bicuspid \\nfragment with severe occlusal wear (1748, Unit 5, 30-40 cm); 22 long \\nbone fragments, one phalange, and eight cranial bone fragments (1756, \\nUnit 6, 20-30 cm); two tooth fragments (including one bicuspid and one \\nroot) and two bone fragments (1757, Unit 6, 20-30 cm); one burned tooth \\nfragment (1664, Unit 7, 10-20 cm); two lower bicuspid fragments (1669, \\nUnit 7, 20-30 cm); one extremely worn right lateral mandibular incisor \\n(1670, Unit 7, 20-30 cm); left mandibular molar fragments with severe \\nocclusal wear (1671, Unit 7, 20-30 cm); and one tooth fragment (1672, \\nUnit 7, 20-30 cm). No artifacts were found in association with the \\ncremated human bone.\\n    The cremated human bone was examined by Colonel H.P. Riessen in \\n1985 and Dr. Rose Tyson of the San Diego Museum of Man during the \\nNAGPRA inventory process. Reissen\\'s analysis found severe wear present \\non the occlusal surfaces of the teeth, but no evidence of caries or \\nabscesses (1985:14-16). All sutures on the skull fragments are closed, \\nand are characteristic of a more mature individual. The severe occlusal \\nwear, closed sutures, and robustness of the bone indicate the \\nindividual was a 30 or so year old male with possible anemia.\\n    The second individual at CA-KER-2060/H consists of unburned cranial \\nand postcranial bone from an inhumation interment approximately 5 m \\neast of the cremation described above (Riessen 1985; Norwood 1985, \\n1987). The inhumation did not evidence a burial pit, but it appeared \\nthat the grave had been dug to the level of the caliche. Riessen \\n(1985:3) describes the burial as lying in an extended position, face \\nupward with a northwest-southeast orientation; head oriented to the \\nnorthwest. The ISOCAT catalog numbers for the inhumation include: one \\ntibia fragment (1639a); post-cranial bone (1640); and rib fragment \\n(4279). Three artifacts were found in association with the inhumation, \\nand include two Cottonwood Triangular arrow points (ISOCAT \\n1481, translucent white chalcedony; ISOCAT 1482, red and white \\nchalcedony) and one bone tool (ISOCAT 1483).\\n    Riessen (1985:13) analyzed the bone from the inhumation in 1985, \\nand concluded that the individual was probably a 32 or so year old \\nmale, 5 foot 7 inches in height, who showed no gross evidence of trauma \\nor pathology. At first it was not clear whether the well preserved \\nunburned bone in the inhumation represented a Native American or \\nEuroamerican burial. The platymeric index of the individual\\'s femur, \\nfor example, is 84.4, a value close to that of English populations and \\nhigher than the mean (74) for Native Americans (Riessen 1985:14). Other \\nindices such as the index of curvature (1.0) and index of torsion \\n(21.45), however, are closer to the mean values for Native American \\npopulations. Based on this information and associated Cottonwood \\nTriangular arrow points, one of which was found in close proximity to \\nthe individual\\'s left arm, the inhumation appears to be a Native \\nAmerican burial dating to the Saratoga Springs or Late Periods (A.D. \\n500-1770).\\n    The estimated date of occupation at the CA-LAN-2060/H site is A.D. \\n500-1770. This is primarily based on the presence of the aforementioned \\nCottonwood Triangular arrow points with the inhumation (Earle et al. \\n1997a). It is not possible to positively determine the cultural \\naffiliation of the human remains (Campbell et al. 1997). Ethnohistoric \\ninformation nevertheless indicates that they are probably affiliated \\nwith one of the five historically-documented tribes (Chemehuevi, \\nKawaiisu, Kitanemuk, Serrano, or Tataviam) in the region (Earle 1997).\\n    In 1987, the BHPO surface collected a fossilized human molar or \\npremolar crown fragment at the CA-KER-2241 (EAFB-907) site (EAFB \\nHistoric Preservation Office file 88-A). The discovery of the tooth \\n(ISOCAT 2286) occurred during legally authorized a Base-wide \\ninventory of paleontologic resources by the San Bernardino County \\nMuseum (Reynolds 1988:76c, Rochez Ridge paleontological complex). The \\ntooth was found in Locus 4 in the proximity of two chert flakes. The \\ntype of interment that the tooth may have been part of is unknown.\\n    Due to the lack of diagnostic artifacts, no determination has been \\nmade on the CA-LAN-2241 site\\'s estimated date of occupation. The \\nchronological relationship of the tooth to the site\\'s late Pleistocene \\npaleontological finds is unknown. The cultural affiliation of the human \\nremains also can not be positively determined (Campbell et al. 1997). \\nEthnohistoric information, however, indicates that the tooth may be \\naffiliated with one of the five tribes (Chemehuevi, Kawaiisu, \\nKitanemuk, Serrano, or Tataviam) who were present in the region in \\nhistoric times (Earle 1997).\\n    In 1988, RECON conducted legally authorized test excavations at the \\nCA-LAN-1158 (EAFB-207) site and recovered burned human bone \\nrepresenting one cremated individual (EAFB Historic Preservation Office \\nfile 88-E). Native Americans were not consulted at the time the human \\nremains were recovered from the CA-LAN-1158 site. The bone was not \\nidentified until they were examined by Dr. Rose Tyson of the San Diego \\nMuseum of Man during the NAGPRA inventory process. The individual is \\nrepresented by a left distal fibula fragment and three probable cranial \\nbone fragments (RECON CAT 163-565a). The human bone was \\nrecovered\\n\\n[[Page 1030]]\\n\\nfrom a cremation interment in Unit 46 (Locus B)(Hector et al. 1988:27).\\n    The estimated date of occupation at the CA-LAN-1158 site is 2000 \\nB.C.-A.D. 1770 or the Gypsum through Late Periods. This is based on the \\npresence of Cottonwood Triangular arrow points, Olivella sp. shell \\nbeads, and Haliotis sp. shell elsewhere on the site (Earle et al. \\n1997a). The cultural affiliation of the human remains can not be \\npositively determined (Campbell et al. 1997). Ethnohistoric \\ninformation, however, indicates that the cremation internment is \\nprobably affiliated with one of the five tribes (Chemehuevi, Kawaiisu, \\nKitanemuk, Serrano, or Tataviam) who utilized the region in historic \\ntimes (Earle 1997).\\n    In 1990, the BHPO surface collected one burned human tooth \\nrepresenting one individual at the CA-KER-796 (EAFB-199; AVAS-40) site \\n(EAFB Historic Preservation Office file 90a-Jud). No Native Americans \\nwere consulted at the time the tooth was discovered. The tooth was not \\nidentified as a human remain until it was examined by Dr. Rose Tyson of \\nthe San Diego Museum of Man during the NAGPRA inventory process. The \\ntype of interment that the tooth came from is unknown although it may \\nhave been part of a cremation. The tooth (ISOCAT 4672) is a \\nprobable canine with severe occlusal wear, exposed pulp cavity, and \\nsecondary dentine formation. Two small areas of enamel are also visible \\nat the root juncture on the lingual and buccal surfaces of the tooth.\\n    No determination has been made on the estimated date of occupation \\nof the CA- KER-796 site. The cultural affiliation of the tooth also can \\nnot be positively determined (Campbell et al. 1997). Ethnohistoric \\ninformation, however, indicates that the tooth may be affiliated with \\none of the five tribes (Chemehuevi, Kawaiisu, Kitanemuk, Serrano, or \\nTataviam) who utilized the region in historic times (Earle 1997).\\n    The ethnohistoric information establishing the relationship between \\nthese tribes and the Native American human remains and associated \\nfunerary objects consists of ethnographies, language studies, Spanish \\nmission records, oral interviews, and other sources (Earle 1997).\\n    Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Air \\nForce Flight Test Center have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 \\n(d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains \\nof nine individuals of Native American ancestry. Officials of the Air \\nForce Flight Test Center have also determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR \\n10.2 (d)(2), the 24 objects listed above are reasonably believed to \\nhave been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of \\ndeath or later as part of the death rite or ceremony. Lastly, officials \\nof the Air Force Flight Test Center have determined that, pursuant to \\n43 CFR 10.2 (e), there is a relationship of shared group identity which \\ncan be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains \\nand associated funerary objects and the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe of the \\nChemehuevi Reservation, the San Manuel Band of Serrano Mission Indians \\nof the San Manual Reservation, the Morongo Band of Cahuilla Mission \\nIndians of the Morongo Reservation, and the Colorado River Indian \\nTribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation.\\n    This notice has been sent to officials of the Chemehuevi Indian \\nTribe of the Chemehuevi Reservation, the San Manuel Band of Serrano \\nMission Indians of the San Manual Reservation, the Morongo Band of \\nCahuilla Mission Indians of the Morongo Reservation, and the Colorado \\nRiver Indian Tribes of the Colorado River Indian Reservation. \\nRepresentatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be \\nculturally affiliated with these human remains and associated funerary \\nobjects should contact David N.
