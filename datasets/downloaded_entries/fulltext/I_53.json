This site is also known as Smith\\'s Island, Baldwin\\'s Isle, Iroquois Isle, and Indian Isle. The human remains were acquired during an Archaeological Society of Central New York (Auburn) dig directed by Peter Pratt. The human remains belong to two adults of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The nine associated funerary objects are one faunal bone, one chert projectile point, two plain pottery sherds, and five seed beads of unknown material.\\n        The site is considered part of an Onondaga occupation dating to the 16th to 18th century based the artifacts recovered, which include seed beads.\\n        In 1977-1978, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual was removed from the site of the City of Fulton sewage treatment and collection facility located in the Town of Fulton in Oswego County, NY. The human remains were acquired during a stage 1 and 2 survey by Peter and Marjorie Pratt for the City of Fulton sewage treatment and collection facility. The human remains belong to one juvenile of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.\\n        In the vicinity of the site, prehistoric occupation has been identified dating back to the Archaic. Known Onondaga habitation nearby supports an affiliation of the site with the Onondaga.\\n        In 1970-1971, human remains consisting, at minimum, of two individuals were removed from the Jayne/LaPoint site, on a beach at the LaPoint farm near the mouth of the Salmon River and directly south of Selkirk Shores State Park in Richland, Oswego County, NY. The site was excavated by the Beauchamp Society. The site was discovered when seventh grader Joan Jayne found a burial that had eroded onto the beach owned by Robert LaPoint. The human remains were removed from two separate burials, each one containing an adult of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The four associated funerary objects are one piece of unidentified wood, one unknown wooden artifact, one soil sample, and one unidentified pottery sherd.\\n        The Jayne/LaPoint site is a prehistoric fishing camp dating primarily from A.D. 1100 to 1450 (Late Woodland period) based on the artifacts recovered. Additional, intrusive burials from the 16th and 19th century are also present. At least one of the 16th century intrusive burials (not associated with the main site) was transferred to SUNY Oswego.\\n        In 1961-1962, human remains consisting, at minimum, of nine individuals were removed from the Pen site (also known as Jamesville Pen), from a burial ground closely associated with Keough Farm Site, in Onondaga County, NY. The human remains were acquired during excavations directed by Peter Pratt that were sponsored by William Ennis. The human remains belong to one adult of indeterminate sex (Burial 1); one adult of indeterminate sex (Burial 15); one juvenile (5-10 years) of indeterminate sex (Burial 54); one infant neonate (age could be <0) of indeterminate sex; one juvenile (1-5 years) of indeterminate sex; three adults of indeterminate sex; and one young adult (19-25 years) of indeterminate sex. No known individuals were identified. The 89 associated funerary objects are two unidentified faunal bones, 25 possible turtle faunal bones, one carnivore tooth, three shell beads (possible preforms), one soil sample with tiny faunal bone fragments, one rusted metal unidentified object, 55 shell beads, and one unidentified faunal bone.\\n        The Pen site includes both a village habitation and a burial ground dating to A.D. 1682-1696, based on artifacts recovered with the burials and habitation.\\n        At an unknown time, human remains consisting, at minimum, of three individuals were recovered from the Valley Oaks site, located in Onondaga, in Onondaga County, NY. These human remains were transferred to SUNY Oswego at an unknown time. The human remains belong to one young adult (16-25 years) possibly male (Burial 2); one adult of indeterminate sex (Burial 3); and one young adult (14-21 years) of indeterminate sex (Burial 4).
