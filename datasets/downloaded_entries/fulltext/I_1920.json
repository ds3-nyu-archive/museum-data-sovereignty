Museum records note that the human remains were removed from a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrave in Pima cemetery, Edge of mesa.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  No known individual was identified.  The three funerary objects are a bowl, an iron chisel-like blade, and a clay ball.\\n        The cultural affiliation was determined by the museum record reference to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPima cemetery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to the presence of an Euroamerican object with the burial.\\n        Based on the above-mentioned information, officials of the Phoebe A.
