The determinations in this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the cultural items. The National Park Service is not responsible for the determinations in this notice.\\n\\n        In 1958, cultural items were removed from a burial at the Mission San Xavier del Bac site, AZ AA:16:10(ASM), Pima County, AZ, during legally authorized excavations conducted by the Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, and Arizona State Museum under the direction of Bernard L. Fontana. The unassociated funerary objects were accessioned into the Museum\\'s collections in 1959. The 100 unassociated funerary objects are shell beads.\\n        \\n        The site is on church owned property within the boundaries of the San Xavier Indian Reservation. Father Eusebio Kino visited the O\\'odham village of Bac in 1692 and established Mission San Xavier. He reported the presence of 800 inhabitants at the time of his first visit. The same population has continued to occupy the land in the vicinity of the mission throughout the historic period. The unassociated funerary objects removed from the Mission san Xavier del Bac site are from historic times. Cultural continuity between the prehistoric occupants of the region and present day O\\'odham and Pee-Posh is supported by continuities in settlement pattern, architectural technologies, basketry, textiles, ceramic technology, ritual practices, and oral traditions. The descendants of the historic O\\'odham and Pee-Posh are members of the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Officials of the Arizona State Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(B), the 100 cultural items described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony and are believed, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have been removed from a specific burial site of an Native American individual. Officials of the Arizona State Museum also have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the unassociated funerary objects and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona.\\n        Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the unassociated funerary objects should contact John Madsen, Repatriation Coordinator, Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, telephone (520) 621-4795, before March 26, 2008. Repatriation of the unassociated funerary objects to the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona may proceed after that date if no additional claimants come forward.\\n        The Arizona State Museum is responsible for notifying the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona that this notice has been published.\\n        \\n          Dated: December 19, 2007\\n          Sherry Hutt,\\n          Manager, National NAGPRA Program.\\n        \\n      \\n      [FR Doc.
