Simmons. The collection was donated to the Fowler Museum at UCLA by Thomas Hinton in 1956. The 69 unassociated funerary objects are 17 clay plaques, 1 shell bead, 8 slate palettes, 1 shell, 1 ceramic sherd, 1 small ceramic bowl, 3 stone gaming pieces, 2 stone plaque fragments, 3 red clay vessels, 16 shell disc beads, 1 lead globular, 2 pieces of ochre, 4 organic fossils, and 9 awl fragments.\\n\\n        The Van Liere Ranch site was a burial ground with numerous Hohokam cremations and other features. This site is dated from A.D. 300\\xe2\\x80\\x941500 based on the cultural materials found at the site, which are identified by archeologists and cultural experts as consistent with Hohokam culture. There are burial records that describe the excavation of each burial and include field and artifact photos, drawings, and site maps. Except for an infant tooth that is not associated with these funerary objects, the human remains were not removed from the ground. The unassociated funerary objects are identified based on their contextual burial designations and burial excavation notes and photos.\\n        \\n        The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community of the Salt River Reservation, Arizona, has submitted a repatriation claim for the cultural items described in this notice, on behalf of itself and the Ak Chin Indian Community of the Maricopa (Ak Chin) Indian Reservation, Arizona; Gila River Indian Community of the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona; and Tohono O\\'odham Nation of Arizona (hereinafter referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Four Southern Tribes of Arizona\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).
