Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains may contact the ARP. Disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribes described below may occur if no additional requestors come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2012/09/17/2012-22751.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "77 FR 57113", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains should contact the ARP at", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-11058", "2200-1100-665"], "document_number": "2012-22751", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 57114, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2012/09/17/2012-22751.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/09/17/2012-22751/notice-of-inventory-completion-us-department-of-agriculture-forest-service-arapaho-and-roosevelt", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2012-22751?publication_date=2012-09-17", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2012-09-17/2012-22751/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 83, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-09-17/pdf/2012-22751.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-22751.pdf?1347627621", "publication_date": "2012-09-17", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2012/09/17/2012-22751.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 57113, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest and Pawnee National Grasslands, Fort Collins, CO", "toc_doc": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest and Pawnee National Grasslands, Fort Collins, CO", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 77}
