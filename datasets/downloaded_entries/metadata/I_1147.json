{"abstract": "In a Notice of Inventory Completion (75 FR 67998, Thursday, November 4, 2010), Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Michigan, was listed as being culturally affiliated to human remains and associated funerary objects removed from the Gyftakis site (20MK51), Mackinac County, MI, however, since publication, additional consultation has resulted in a determination that the human remains and associated funerary objects are culturally unidentifiable. Therefore, this Notice of Inventory Completion corrects the affiliation of the human remains and associated funerary objects that were removed from the Gyftakis site (20MK51), Mackinac County, MI, described in the previously published Notice of Inventory Completion to that of culturally unidentifiable Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. Western Michigan University, Department of Anthropology has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes, and has determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects may contact the Western Michigan University, Department of Anthropology. Disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribe stated below may occur if no additional requestors come forward.", "action": "Notice; correction.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2011/06/21/2011-15436.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "76 FR 36152", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact the Western Michigan University, Department of", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["2253-665"], "document_number": "2011-15436", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 36153, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2011/06/21/2011-15436.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/06/21/2011-15436/notice-of-inventory-completion-western-michigan-university-anthropology-department-kalamazoo-mi", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2011-15436?publication_date=2011-06-21", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2011-06-21/2011-15436/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 36, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2011-06-21/pdf/2011-15436.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": null, "publication_date": "2011-06-21", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2011/06/21/2011-15436.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 36152, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Western Michigan University, Anthropology Department, Kalamazoo, MI; Correction", "toc_doc": "Western Michigan University, Anthropology Department, Kalamazoo, MI; Correction", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 76}
