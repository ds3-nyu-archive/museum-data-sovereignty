{"abstract": "Pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Midwest Regional Office determined that the physical remains of 12 individuals of Native American ancestry and three associated funerary objects in Effigy Mounds National Monument's collections, described below in Information about cultural items, are culturally unidentifiable. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) recommended that Effigy Mounds National Monument, Harpers Ferry, IA, repatriate the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska; Sac and Fox Nation, Oklahoma; and Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa. The National Park Service publishes this notice on behalf of Effigy Mounds National Monument as part of the National Park Service's administrative responsibilities under NAGPRA. The determinations within this notice are the sole responsibility of the museum, institution, or Federal agency that has control of the Native American human remains and associated funerary objects. The National NAGPRA Program is not responsible for the determinations within this notice.
