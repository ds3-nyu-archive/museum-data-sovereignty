{"abstract": "The Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, and has determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request to the University of California, Berkeley. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains to the Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2016/11/09/2016-26981.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "81 FR 78847", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to the University", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-22248", "PPWOCRADN0-PCU00RP14.R50000"], "document_number": "2016-26981", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 78848, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2016/11/09/2016-26981.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/09/2016-26981/notice-of-inventory-completion-phoebe-a-hearst-museum-of-anthropology-at-the-university-of", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2016-26981?publication_date=2016-11-09", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2016-11-09/2016-26981/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 211, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-11-09/pdf/2016-26981.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-26981.pdf?1478612730", "publication_date": "2016-11-09", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2016/11/09/2016-26981.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 78847, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Phoebe A.
