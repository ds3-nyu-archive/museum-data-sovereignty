{"abstract": "The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate federally recognized Indian Tribes, and has determined that a cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and present- day federally recognized Indian Tribes can reasonably be traced. Lineal descendants or representatives of any federally recognized Indian Tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to TVA. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the federally recognized Indian Tribes stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/09/05/2017-18688.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "82 FR 41985", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Lineal descendants or representatives of any federally recognized Indian Tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-NPS0023810"], "document_number": "2017-18688", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 41987, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2017/09/05/2017-18688.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/05/2017-18688/notice-of-inventory-completion-tennessee-valley-authority-knoxville-tn", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2017-18688?publication_date=2017-09-05", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2017-09-05/2017-18688/mods.xml", "page_length": 3, "page_views": {"count": 153, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-09-05/pdf/2017-18688.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2017-18688.pdf?1504269943", "publication_date": "2017-09-05", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2017/09/05/2017-18688.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 41985, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN", "toc_doc": "Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 82, "index": "I_383"}
