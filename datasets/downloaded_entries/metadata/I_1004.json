Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects may contact the San Francisco State University NAGPRA Program. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribe stated below may occur if no additional claimants come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2012/09/28/2012-23918.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "77 FR 59648", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains and associated funerary objects should contact the San Francisco State University NAGPRA", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-11194", "2200-1100-665"], "document_number": "2012-23918", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 59649, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2012/09/28/2012-23918.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/09/28/2012-23918/notice-of-inventory-completion-san-francisco-state-university-nagpra-program-san-francisco-ca", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2012-23918?publication_date=2012-09-28", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2012-09-28/2012-23918/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 137, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-09-28/pdf/2012-23918.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-23918.pdf?1348752753", "publication_date": "2012-09-28", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2012/09/28/2012-23918.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 59648, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: San Francisco State University, NAGPRA Program, San Francisco, CA", "toc_doc": "San Francisco State University, NAGPRA Program, San Francisco, CA", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 77, "index": "I_1004"}
