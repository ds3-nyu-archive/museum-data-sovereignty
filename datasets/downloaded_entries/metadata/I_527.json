{"abstract": "The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, and has determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and present-day Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to TARL. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribes stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2016/07/11/2016-16277.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "81 FR 44893", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-21438", "PPWOCRADN0-PCU00RP14.R50000"], "document_number": "2016-16277", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 44896, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2016/07/11/2016-16277.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/11/2016-16277/notice-of-inventory-completion-texas-archeological-research-laboratory-austin-tx", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2016-16277?publication_date=2016-07-11", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2016-07-11/2016-16277/mods.xml", "page_length": 4, "page_views": {"count": 26, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-07-11/pdf/2016-16277.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-16277.pdf?1467982031", "publication_date": "2016-07-11", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2016/07/11/2016-16277.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 44893, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin, TX", "toc_doc": "Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin, TX", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 81}
