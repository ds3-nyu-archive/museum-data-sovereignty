{"abstract": "The University of Montana, the Museum of the Rockies at Montana State University, and the University of Wyoming, Department of Anthropology, have completed an inventory of human remains, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribe, and have determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the remains and any present-day Indian tribe. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains may contact the University of Montana, which is acting on its own behalf and for the Museum of the Rockies and the University of Wyoming. Disposition of the human remains to the Indian tribe stated below may occur if no additional requestors come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2012/12/18/2012-30463.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "77 FR 74873", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains should contact the", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-11463", "2200-1100-665"], "document_number": "2012-30463", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 74874, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2012/12/18/2012-30463.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/12/18/2012-30463/notice-of-inventory-completion-university-of-montana-missoula-mt-museum-of-the-rockies-at-montana", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2012-30463?publication_date=2012-12-18", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2012-12-18/2012-30463/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 47, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-12-18/pdf/2012-30463.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-30463.pdf?1355752501", "publication_date": "2012-12-18", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2012/12/18/2012-30463.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 74873, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: University of Montana, Missoula, MT; Museum of the Rockies at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT; and University of Wyoming, Department of Anthropology, Laramie, WY", "toc_doc": "University of Montana, Missoula, MT; Museum of the Rockies at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT; and University of Wyoming, Department of Anthropology, Laramie, WY", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 77, "index": "I_985"}
