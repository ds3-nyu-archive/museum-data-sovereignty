{"abstract": "The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribe, and has determined that there is a cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and a present-day Indian tribe. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects may contact the UCSB. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribe stated below may occur if no additional claimants come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2012/06/12/2012-14290.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "77 FR 34991", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains and associated funerary", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-10347", "2200-1100-665"], "document_number": "2012-14290", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 34997, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2012/06/12/2012-14290.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/06/12/2012-14290/notice-of-inventory-completion-university-of-california-santa-barbara-repository-of-archaeological", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2012-14290?publication_date=2012-06-12", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2012-06-12/2012-14290/mods.xml", "page_length": 7, "page_views": {"count": 360, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-06-12/pdf/2012-14290.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-14290.pdf?1339419366", "publication_date": "2012-06-12", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2012/06/12/2012-14290.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 34991, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: University of California, Santa Barbara, Repository of Archaeological and Ethnographic Collections, Santa Barbara, CA", "toc_doc": "University of California, Santa Barbara, Repository of Archaeological and Ethnographic Collections, Santa Barbara, CA", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 77, "index": "I_1041"}
