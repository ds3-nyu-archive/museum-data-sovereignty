{"abstract": "The Denver Museum of Nature & Science has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes, and has determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day Indian tribe. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects may contact the museum. Disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribes stated below may occur if no additional requestors come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2011/03/15/2011-5857.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "76 FR 14061", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains should contact the Denver", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["2253-665"], "document_number": "2011-5857", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 14062, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2011/03/15/2011-5857.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/03/15/2011-5857/notice-of-inventory-completion-denver-museum-of-nature-and-science-denver-co", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2011-5857?publication_date=2011-03-15", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2011-03-15/2011-5857/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 64, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2011-03-15/pdf/2011-5857.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": null, "publication_date": "2011-03-15", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2011/03/15/2011-5857.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 14061, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Denver Museum of Nature & Science, Denver, CO", "toc_doc": "Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Denver, CO", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 76}
