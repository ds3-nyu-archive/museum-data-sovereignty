{"abstract": "History Colorado (formerly the Colorado Historical Society) has completed an inventory of human remains, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes, and has determined that there is insufficient evidence to reasonably establish cultural affiliation between the human remains and present-day Indian tribes. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains may contact History Colorado. Disposition of the human remains to the Indian tribes stated below may occur if no additional claimants come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2012/02/27/2012-4531.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "77 FR 11573", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains should contact History", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["2253-665"], "document_number": "2012-4531", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 11575, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2012/02/27/2012-4531.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/02/27/2012-4531/notice-of-inventory-completion-history-colorado-denver-co", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2012-4531?publication_date=2012-02-27", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2012-02-27/2012-4531/mods.xml", "page_length": 3, "page_views": {"count": 43, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-02-27/pdf/2012-4531.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-04531.pdf?1330095023", "publication_date": "2012-02-27", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2012/02/27/2012-4531.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 11573, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: History Colorado, Denver, CO", "toc_doc": "History Colorado, Denver, CO", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 77}
