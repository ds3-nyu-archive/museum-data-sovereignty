{"abstract": "The National Park Service published a notice of inventory completion in the Federal Register on May 23, 2000 for Native American human remains and associated funerary objects from Agate Fossil Beds National Monument and Scotts Bluff National Monument. The notice incorrectly listed one human skull as likely representing the remains of a Native American individual and one deer bone associated with these remains as an associated funerary object. Based on additional information provided by an August 2000 bioanthropological analysis of this skull, the Agate Fossil Beds National Monument superintendent determined that the human remains are not Native American and, therefore, the deer bone associated with these remains is not an associated funerary object.", "action": "Correction.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2001/01/10/01-649.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "66 FR 2001", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": null, "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": [], "document_number": "01-649", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 2002, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2001/01/10/01-649.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/01/10/01-649/correction-notice-of-inventory-completion-for-native-american-human-remains-and-associated-funerary", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/01-649?publication_date=2001-01-10", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2001-01-10/01-649/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 17, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-01-10/pdf/01-649.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": null, "publication_date": "2001-01-10", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2001/01/10/01-649.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 2001, "subtype": null, "title": "Correction; Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, National Park Service, Harrison, NE and Scotts Bluff National Monument, National Park Service, Gerring, NE", "toc_doc": "Inventory from Nebraska panhandle region; correction", "toc_subject": null, "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 66, "index": "I_2126"}
