{"abstract": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Kootenai National Forest, with assistance from the Army Corps of Engineer's Mandatory Center of Expertise for the Curation and Management of Archeological Collections (ACOE), has completed an inventory of human remains, in consultation with the appropriate Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations and has determined that there is a cultural affiliation between the human remains and present-day Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Lineal descendants or representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request to the Kootenai National Forest.
