{"abstract": "The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in consultation with the appropriate federally recognized Indian Tribes, and has determined that a cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and any present-day federally recognized Indian Tribes cannot be reasonably traced. Representatives of any federally recognized Indian Tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to TVA. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the federally recognized Indian Tribe stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2017/09/05/2017-18687.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "82 FR 41990", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any federally recognized Indian Tribe not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to TVA at", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-23787"], "document_number": "2017-18687", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 41991, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2017/09/05/2017-18687.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/05/2017-18687/notice-of-inventory-completion-tennessee-valley-authority-knoxville-tn", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2017-18687?publication_date=2017-09-05", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2017-09-05/2017-18687/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 154, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-09-05/pdf/2017-18687.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2017-18687.pdf?1504269942", "publication_date": "2017-09-05", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2017/09/05/2017-18687.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 41990, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN", "toc_doc": "Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 82, "index": "I_385"}
