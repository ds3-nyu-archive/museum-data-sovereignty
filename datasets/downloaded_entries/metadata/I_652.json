Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request to Texas State. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains to the non-Federally recognized Indian group stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2015/08/31/2015-21488.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "80 FR 52495", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Texas State at", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-18953", "PPWOCRADN0-PCU00RP14.R50000"], "document_number": "2015-21488", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 52496, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2015/08/31/2015-21488.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/08/31/2015-21488/notice-of-inventory-completion-center-for-archaeological-studies-texas-state-university-san-marcos", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2015-21488?publication_date=2015-08-31", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2015-08-31/2015-21488/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 148, "last_updated": "2020-04-02 20:15:24 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-08-31/pdf/2015-21488.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-21488.pdf?1440765987", "publication_date": "2015-08-31", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2015/08/31/2015-21488.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 52495, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX", "toc_doc": "Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 80, "index": "I_652"}
