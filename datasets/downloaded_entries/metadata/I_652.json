{"abstract": "The Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University (Texas State), has completed an inventory of human remains, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, and has determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and any present-day Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request to Texas State. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains to the non-Federally recognized Indian group stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2015/08/31/2015-21488.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "80 FR 52495", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains should submit a written request with information in support of the request to Texas State at", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-18953", "PPWOCRADN0-PCU00RP14.R50000"], "document_number": "2015-21488", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 52496, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2015/08/31/2015-21488.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/08/31/2015-21488/notice-of-inventory-completion-center-for-archaeological-studies-texas-state-university-san-marcos", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2015-21488?publication_date=2015-08-31", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2015-08-31/2015-21488/mods.xml", "page_length": 2, "page_views": {"count": 146, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-08-31/pdf/2015-21488.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-21488.pdf?1440765987", "publication_date": "2015-08-31", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2015/08/31/2015-21488.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 52495, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX", "toc_doc": "Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 80}
