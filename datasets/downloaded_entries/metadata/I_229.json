{"abstract": "The Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology at the University of Idaho (``Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology'') and the Museum of the Rockies at Montana State University (``Museum of the Rockies'') have completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in consultation with the appropriate Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, and have determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects and present-day Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request to the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology or the Museum of the Rockies. If no additional requestors come forward, transfer of control of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations stated in this notice may proceed.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2018/09/10/2018-19540.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "83 FR 45653", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization not identified in this notice that wish to request transfer of control of these human remains and associated funerary objects should submit a written request with information in support of the request to the Alfred W.
