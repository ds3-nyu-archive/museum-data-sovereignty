{"abstract": "The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the University of Tennessee McClung Museum (McClung Museum) have completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes, and have determined that there is a cultural affiliation between the human remains and associated funerary objects, and a present-day Indian tribe. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects may contact the TVA and McClung Museum. Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribe stated below may occur if no additional claimants come forward.", "action": "Notice.", "agencies": [{"raw_name": "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR", "name": "Interior Department", "id": 253, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253", "parent_id": null, "slug": "interior-department"}, {"raw_name": "National Park Service", "name": "National Park Service", "id": 362, "url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service", "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362", "parent_id": 253, "slug": "national-park-service"}], "body_html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2012/06/04/2012-13454.html", "cfr_references": [], "citation": "77 FR 32982", "comment_url": null, "comments_close_on": null, "correction_of": null, "corrections": [], "dates": "Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes it has a cultural affiliation with the human remains and associated funerary", "disposition_notes": null, "docket_ids": ["NPS-WASO-NAGPRA-10270", "2200-1100-665"], "document_number": "2012-13454", "effective_on": null, "end_page": 32982, "executive_order_notes": null, "executive_order_number": null, "full_text_xml_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/xml/2012/06/04/2012-13454.xml", "html_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/06/04/2012-13454/notice-of-inventory-completion-tennessee-valley-authority-and-the-university-of-tennessee-mcclung", "images": {}, "json_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents/2012-13454?publication_date=2012-06-04", "mods_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/granule/FR-2012-06-04/2012-13454/mods.xml", "page_length": 1, "page_views": {"count": 84, "last_updated": "2020-03-20 20:15:28 -0400"}, "pdf_url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-06-04/pdf/2012-13454.pdf", "presidential_document_number": null, "proclamation_number": null, "public_inspection_pdf_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-13454.pdf?1338555141", "publication_date": "2012-06-04", "raw_text_url": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/text/2012/06/04/2012-13454.txt", "regulation_id_number_info": {}, "regulation_id_numbers": [], "regulations_dot_gov_info": {}, "regulations_dot_gov_url": null, "significant": null, "signing_date": null, "start_page": 32982, "subtype": null, "title": "Notice of Inventory Completion: Tennessee Valley Authority and the University of Tennessee McClung Museum, Knoxville, TN", "toc_doc": "Tennessee Valley Authority and University of Tennessee McClung Museum, Knoxville, TN", "toc_subject": "Inventory Completions:", "topics": [], "type": "Notice", "volume": 77}
